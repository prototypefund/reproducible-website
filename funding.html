      As a quick refresher, whilst anyone can inspect the source code of free
      and open source software for malicious flaws, most software is
      distributed pre-compiled to end users.
    </p>
    <p>
      The motivation behind the Reproducible Builds project is to permit
      verification that no flaws have been introduced during the compilation
      process&mdash;either maliciously or accidentally&mdash;by promising
      identical results are always generated from a given source, thus allowing
      multiple third-parties to come to a consensus on whether a computer is
      compromised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your continued support will be key in solving this problem, which affects
      computer systems of all sizes, from embedded microcontrollers to the
      largest government systems.

    <p>
      The Reproducible Builds team has demonstrated that it is, in principle,
      possible to build a Linux distribution in a reproducible manner and have
      solved many of the issues in doing so.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the next release of Debian ("buster") is currently not yet
      100% reproducible and funding to support on-going maintenance of
      critical infrastructure will be absolutely essential to reach this goal.
    </p>

    <p>
      This not only includes the administration of over 50 build nodes across
      multiple architectures, it requires continuous and patient work with
      package maintainers and upstreams to merge reproducibility-related
      patches. It also includes extending the scope of
      <a href="https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/">our testing
      framework</a> to even more projects, as well as improving the existing
      tests and reports.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, there are currently no tools that let a user know whether
      packages that they are installing are reproducible or not, required to
      "close the loop" and allow end-users to finally truly validate the
      software they are running on their machines.
    </p>

    <p>
      Furthermore, maintaining momentum &mdash; both in terms of public
      perception and in private &mdash; around the various related projects
      such as <em>diffoscope</em>, etc. will be key in ensuring a reproducible
      "buster" becomes a reality.
