      <strong>Reproducible builds</strong> are a set of software development
      practices that create an <strong>independently-verifiable path</strong>
      from <strong>source code to the binary code</strong> used by computers.

      Whilst anyone can inspect the source code of free and open source
      software for malicious flaws, most software is distributed pre-compiled
      with no method to confirm whether they correspond.
    </p>
    <p>
      This incentivises attacks on developers who release software, not only
      via traditional exploitation but moreover in the forms of political
      influence, blackmail or even threats of violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is particularly a concern for developers collaborating on privacy or
      security software: attacking these typically result in compromising
      particularly politically-sensitive targets such as dissidents,
      journalists and whistleblowers, as well as anyone wishing to communicate
      securely under a repressive regime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst individual developers are a natural target, it additionally
      encourages attacks on build infrastructure as an successful attack would
      provide access to a large number of downstream computer systems. By
      modifying the generated binaries here instead of modifying the upstream
      source code, illicit changes are essentially invisible to its original
      authors and users alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      The motivation behind <em>reproducible Builds</em> project is therefore
      to allow verification that no vulnerabilities or backdoors have been
      introduced during this compilation process. By promising
      <strong>identical results</strong> are always generated from a given
      source, this allows <strong>multiple third-parties</strong> to come to a
      consensus on a "correct" result, highlighting any deviations as suspect
      and worthy of scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ability to notice if a developer has been compromised then
      deters such threats or attacks ocurring in the first place as any
      compromise would be quickly detected. This offers comfort to front-liners
      that they not only can be threatened, but they would not be co-erced into
      exploiting or exposing their colleagues or end-users.

      First, the <strong>build system needs to be made entirely
      deterministic</strong>: transforming a given source must always create
      the same result. For example, the current date and time must not be
      recorded and output always has to be written in the same order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, the set of tools used to perform the build and more generally the
      <strong>build environment</strong> should either be <strong>recorded or
      pre-defined</strong>.
    <p>
      Third, users should be given a way to recreate a close enough build
      environment, perform the build process, and <strong>validate that the
      output matches the original build</strong>.
