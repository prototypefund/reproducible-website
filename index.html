      <strong>Reproducible builds</strong> are a set of software development practices that
      create a <strong>verifiable path from</strong> human-readable
      <strong>source code to</strong> the <strong>binary</strong> code used by
      computers.

      Most aspects of software verification are done on source code, as that is
      what humans can reasonably understand. But most of the time, computers
      require software to be first built into a long string of numbers to be
      used. With <em>reproducible builds</em>, multiple parties can
      <strong>redo this process independently</strong> and ensure they
      <strong>all get <em>exactly</em> the same result</strong>. We can thus
      <strong>gain confidence</strong> that a distributed binary code is indeed
      coming from a given source code.

      What made the recent <a style="text-decoration: none;"
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal">Volkswagen
      emissions scandal</a> possible is software that has been designed to lie
      about its sensors in a lab environment. Having the source code under
      public scrutiny would have made adding such a misfeature only a little
      more difficult. Without <em>reproducible builds</em>, it is hard to
      confirm that the binary code installed in the car was actually made using
      the source code that has been verified.

      First, the <strong>build system needs to be made entirely
      deterministic</strong>: transforming a given source must always
      create the same result. Typically, the current date and time must not be
      recorded and output always has to be written in the same order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, the set of tools used to perform the build and more generally
      the <strong>build environment</strong> should either be <strong>recorded
      or pre-defined</strong>.
    <p>
      Third, users should be given a way to recreate a close enough build
      environment, perform the build process, and <strong>verify that the output
      matches the original build</strong>.
