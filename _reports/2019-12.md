* rb5 summit:
  - kpcyrd made https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/alpine/main/py3-uritemplate/py3-uritemplate-3.0.0-r4.apk.html the first reproducible alpine package in our CI
  - matia, jelle and apacar discussed some database changes for the tests.r.o database to allow submitting results of attempts to verify officially distributed packages from for example Arch Linux.
  - matia did some maintenance work on the reproducible builds database to convert timestamps from strings to real timestamps data types
  - matia renamed the Arch Linux suites from archlinux_$suite to $suite.
