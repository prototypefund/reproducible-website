#### openSUSE

* patches:
    * [`hidviz`](https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/754485) (use convert -strip)
    * [`rpmlint-mini`](https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/754705) (sort python compile file list)

#### Arch Linux

During the summit the database structure on tests.reproducible-builds.org was
changed and the testing jobs updated. Work has been started on a verification
test job which rebuilds officially released packages and verifies if they are
reproducible. In the hacking time after the summit several packages where made
reproducible which raised the amount of reproducible packages by 1.5%. For example [libxslit](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/libxslt/) was patched with the patch already used openSUSE and Debian.

#### unsorted

* rb5 summit:
  - kpcyrd made https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/alpine/main/py3-uritemplate/py3-uritemplate-3.0.0-r4.apk.html the first reproducible alpine package in our CI
  - mattia, jelle and apacar discussed some database changes for the tests.r.o database to allow submitting results of attempts to verify officially distributed packages from for example Arch Linux.
  - mattia did some maintenance work on the reproducible builds database to convert timestamps from strings to real timestamps data types
  - mattia renamed the Arch Linux suites from archlinux_$suite to $suite.
