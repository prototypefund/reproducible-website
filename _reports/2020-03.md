* Herv√© Boutemy reported on rb-general that [FIXME: Rebuilding and checking Reproducible Builds from Maven Central repository](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2020-March/001862.html), since the release of Apache parent POM version 23 in january, every Apache project using Maven inheriting from this release should have reproducible builds: this is the case for every Maven component release done since then, but also Apache Sling, or Apache Nifi. A follow-up discussion [how to do such rebuilds](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/ra05a971a2de961d27691bd4624850a06a862b4223116c0c904be8397%40%3Cdev.maven.apache.org%3E) was also started.
