>   binary maintainer uploads for bullseye
>   =========================================
>
>   The release of buster also means the bullseye release cycle is about to begin.
>   From now on, we will no longer allow binaries uploaded by maintainers to
>   migrate to testing. This means that you will need to do source-only uploads if
>   you want them to reach bullseye.

* [FIXME](https://bugs.debian.org/926242#132)
