## Software development

#### Upstream patches

The Reproducible Builds project detects, dissects and attempts to fix as many currently-unreproducible packages as possible. We endeavour to send all of our patches upstream where appropriate. This month, we wrote a large number of such patches, including:

* Bernhard M. Wiedemann:
    * [zip](https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/700402) (add SDE clamping of mtime; [also submitted upstream](https://sourceforge.net/p/infozip/patches/25/) and [distropatches](https://github.com/distropatches/zip/commits/opensuse))
    * [plata-theme](https://gitlab.com/tista500/plata-theme/merge_requests/3) (zip mtime)
    * [nulloy](https://github.com/nulloy/nulloy/pull/149) (.zip timestamps)
    * [DVDStyler](https://sourceforge.net/p/dvdstyler/DVDStyler/merge-requests/1/) (.zip ctime)

    * [osc](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc/issues/547) (report multibuild dep bug hindering openSUSE reproducible builds)
