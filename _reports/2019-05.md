**Welcome to the May 2019 report from the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) project!**

In our reports we outline the most important things which have been up to in and around the world of reproducible builds & secure toolchains over the past month.

[![]({{ "/images/reports/2019-05/reproducible-builds.png#right" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://reproducible-builds.org/)

As a quick recap, whilst anyone can inspect the source code of free software for malicious flaws, almost all software is distributed to end users pre-compiled. The motivation behind reproducible builds effort is to ensure no flaws have been introduced during this compilation process by promising identical results are always generated from a given source, thus allowing third-parties to come to a consensus on whether a build was compromised.

In this month's report, we will cover:

* **Media coverage** — *More supply chain attacks, Reproducible Builds on the conference circuit, etc.*
* **Upstream news** — *Mozilla updating their add-on policy, etc.*
* **Distribution work** — *Debian Installer progress, openSUSE updates, etc.*
* **Software development** — *try.diffoscope.org rewrite, upstream patches, etc.*
* **Misc news** — *From our mailing list, etc.*
* **Getting in touch** — *How to contribute, etc.*

## Media coverage

* Adam Greenberg reported on [Wired](https://www.wired.com) about the [Barium](https://www.wired.com/story/barium-supply-chain-hackers/), detailing a single group of malicious actors who appear responsible for a variety supply chain hacks of [CCleaner](https://www.ccleaner.com/), [Asus](https://www.asus.com/) and more, therefore planting backdoors on and gaining access to millions of machines.

* The work of Chris Lamb in/around Debian's Reproducible Builds effort [won a Google Open Source Peer Bonus award](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2019/04/google-open-source-peer-bonus-winners.html), a program with the goal of recognising and supporting the ecosystem and sustainability of free software by rewarding and recognising developers for their contributions to open source projects

* Kushal Das presented at [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/2019/about/) 2019 on [building reproducible Python applications for secured environments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRHi8Ui5vWA). In the talk, Kushal argues that validating the dependencies of the project is very critical along with the actual project source code, referring to incidents where people were [able to steal bitcoins using a popular library](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/11/26/npm_repo_bitcoin_stealer/). His talk uses the [SecureDrop client application](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client) for journalists as an example project and see how he tried to tackle the similar problem.

* [GitHub](https://github.com/) announced [adding a package registry feature](https://github.com/features/package-registry) which [suggest but alas not guarantee](https://github.com/ipfs/package-managers/issues/55) a strong link between the Git repository and the published packages, highlighting the need for Reproducible Builds.

* [Andrew Martin](https://www.binarysludge.com/) [published his slides](https://drive.google.com/a/control-plane.io/file/d/1xUDrcWmB3a_5oMxeIJuqf6vtXZN/view?usp=sharing) for his talk titled [*Rootless, Reproducible and Hermetic: Secure Container Build Showdown*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_Sb96EKFPA) that he gave at [KubeCon 2019](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe-2019/).

## Upstream news

* The [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) "[Package Managers Special Interest Group](https://github.com/ipfs/package-managers#readme)" is [gathering research around package management](https://github.com/ipfs/package-managers/blob/master/docs/papers.md), much of which is relevant to the Reproducible Builds effort.

* [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org)'s update "Add-on Policy" document for the [Firefox web browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/) now [dictates that add-ons may contain "transpiled, minified or otherwise machine-generated code"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/AMO/Policy/Reviews-2019-05), but Mozilla needs to review a copy of the human-readable source code. The author must provide this information to Mozilla during submission along with instructions on how to reproduce the build.

* Atharva Lele is going to work on reproducible builds for the [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org/) embedded Linux project as part of [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), [ensuring that two instances of buildroot running with the same configuration for the same device yield the same result](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5992608243908608).

### Distribution work

[![]({{ "/images/reports/2019-05/opensuse.png#right" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://www.opensuse.org/)

Holger Levsen filed a wishlist request requesting that `.buildinfo` build attestation documents from the [Debian Long Term Support (LTS)](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/) project [are also distributed by the build/archive infrastructure](https://bugs.debian.org/929397) so that the reproducibility status of these security packages can be validated.

Bernhard M. Wiedemann posted his [monthly Reproducible Builds status update](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2019-05/msg00341.html) for the [openSUSE](https://opensuse.org/) distribution.

[![]({{ "/images/reports/2019-05/debian.png#left" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://debian.org/)

There was yet more progress towards making the [Debian Installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debiah-installer/) images reproducible. Following-on from last months, [Chris Lamb](https://chris-lamb.co.uk/) performed some further testing of the generated images and [requested a status update](https://bugs.debian.org/926242#67) which resulted in a call for testing the [possible removal of a now-obsolete workaround](https://bugs.debian.org/926242#87) that is hindering progress.

68 reviews of Debian packages were added, 30 were updated and 11 were removed this month, adding to [our knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html). Chris Lamb discovered, identified and triaged two new issue types, the first identifying randomness in [Fontconfig](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fontconfig/) `.uuid` files&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/0b9e9668) and another [`randomness_in_output_from_perl_deparse`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/430c2d21).

Finally, [GNU Guix](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix) announced its [1.0.0 release](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/blog/2019/gnu-guix-1.0.0-released/).

## Software development

#### Upstream patches

The Reproducible Builds project detects, dissects and attempts to fix as many currently-unreproducible packages as possible. We endeavour to send all of our patches upstream where appropriate. This month, we wrote a large number of such patches, including:

This [was subsequently merged in version `2019.07-rc2`](https://git.denx.de/?p=u-boot.git;a=commit;h=878e2a50b50199cb06ee28df53151e396a29d838).

#### diffoscope

[![]({{ "/images/reports/2019-05/diffoscope.svg#right" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://diffoscope.org)

[diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/) is our in-depth "diff-on-steroids" utility which helps us diagnose reproducibility issues in packages. It does not define reproducibility, but rather provides a helpful and human-readable guidance for packages that are not reproducible, rather than relying essentially-useless diffs.

* Chris Lamb:

    * Support the latest [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) package repository upload requirements by using real [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) comments instead of the `raw` directive&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope.git/commit/edb01aa)] and by stripping out manpage-only parts of the `README` rather than using the `only` directive&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope.git/commit/d06d065)].

    * Fix execution of symbolic links that point to the `bin/diffoscope` entry point in a checked-out version of our Git repository by fully resolving the location as part of dynamically calculating Python's module include path.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope.git/commit/afc63b3)]

    * Add a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope.git/commit/2c37397)] with various subsequent fixups&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope.git/commit/2cb8206)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope.git/commit/8f67fcb)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope.git/commit/ba4b2ae)].

    * Published the resulting Docker image in [diffoscope's container registry](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/container_registry) and updated the [diffoscope homepage](https://diffoscope.org/) to provide "quick start" instructions on how to use diffoscope via this image.

* Mattia Rizzolo:

    * Uploaded version `115` [to Debian experimental](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1040177/accepted-diffoscope-115-source-all-into-experimental/).
    * Adjust various build and test-dependencies, including specifying the [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) video encoding tool/library and the [Black](https://ffmpeg.org/) code formatter&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/0eddfab)] in the build-dependencies&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/d2d3dec)] and reinstating the [oggvideotools](https://sourceforge.net/projects/oggvideotools/) and `procyon-decompiler` as test dependencies, now that are no-longer buggy&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/6940757)], etc.
    * Make the Debian autopkgtests not fail when a limited subset of "required tools" are temporarily unavailable.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/f584fa2)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/3d74240)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/2e11182)]

In addition, Santiago Torres altered the behaviour of the tests to ensure compatibility with various versions of [file(1)]()&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/0f02296)] and Vagrant Cascadian added support for various external tools in [GNU Guix](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/)&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/7f3416f)] and updated the version of *diffoscope* in that distribution&nbsp;[[...](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/commit/?id=ff793da66918ace85048f90dc069415ef067ba06)].


#### try.diffoscope.org

[![]({{ "/images/reports/2019-05/trydiffoscope.png#right" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://try.diffoscope.org/)

Chris Lamb made a large number of following changes to the web-based ("no installation required") version of the *[diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org)* tool, [try.diffoscope.org](https://try.diffoscope.org):

* Ported the entire site to Python 3 and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) 2.x as [Python 2.x is due for deprecation](https://pythonclock.org/). This required updates to a huge number of parts around the site including but not limited to completely reconfiguring and integrating the [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/) queue processor, all the string formatting, etc.

* Moved to using the published/public [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image to execute builds instead rolling our own container.

* Updated and upgraded the underlying operating system to the Debian *stable* distribution.

* Moved the [canonical Git repository](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/try.diffoscope.org) from GitHub to the [Reproducible Builds group on salsa.debian.org](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/try.diffoscope.org), requiring moving to GitLab's own [continuous integration (CI) support](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) from [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), working around the aggressive firewall (exclusively outgoing ports 80/443) applied to the [Salsa](https://salsa.debian.org/)-based CI runners.

* Avoid having to update the [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)-provided SSL certificate manually every 90 days by moving to using [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/about/) in `--auto` mode.

#### Test framework

We operate a comprehensive [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)-based testing framework that powers [tests.reproducible-builds.org](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org). The following changes were done in the last month:

* Holger Levsen made the following ([Debian](https://www.debian.org/)-related changes):

    * Reduce the number of `cron(8)` mails for synchronising `.buildinfo` files from eight to one per day.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/40571647)]
    * Run `rsync2buildinfos.debian.net` script every other hour now that it just produces one mail per day.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/67c819fb)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/9db63b7b)]
    * Execute the package scheduler every 2 hours (instead of 3).&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/bb9b49f2)]
    * Switch the [Codethink](https://www.codethink.co.uk/) and OSUOSL nodes to use our updated email relay system.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/45532738)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/88bd5987)]
    * Deal with the (rare) cases of `.buildinfo` files with the same name.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/c7d6f107)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/951dd1c0)]
    * Save and mail the package scheduler results once a day instead of mailing ~8 times a day.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/5e3f7d34)]

* In addition, Holger Levsen made the following distribution-agnositic changes:

    * Notify the `#reproducible-builds` (not `#debian-reproducible`) about Jenkins rebooting and send notifications about offline hosts to this former channel.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/a51ffc69)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/c9d322ef)]
    * Prevent the Jenkins log from growing to over 100G in size.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/8f21110b)]

* Mattia Rizzolo:

    * Use a special code so that remote builds can abort themselves by passing back the command to the "master".&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/17303def)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/33ea96a3)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/923d22a2)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/8f807691)]
    * Fix a pattern matching bug to ensure all "zombie" processes are found.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/33fa12bb)]
    * [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) the `chroot-installation.yaml.py` file.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/839af096)]
    * Set a known [HTTP User Agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent#Use_in_HTTP) for Git, so that server can recognise us.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/c93bdaeb)]
    * Allow network access for the [`debian-installer-netboot-images`](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/debian-installer-netboot-images) Debian package.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/f1e641b8)]

Finally, Vagrant Cascadian removed the deprecated `--buildinfo-id` from the `pbuilder(8)` configuration.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/6376dd4a)] and Holger Levsen [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/08b024a2)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/63cff4ef)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/941f6fd1)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/db0e4ecc)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/5f59a8f8)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/2401e4ee)]
Mattia Rizzolo [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/dd86f22e)] and Vagrant Cascadian all performed a large amount of build node maintenance, system & Jenkins administration.

#### Project website

[![]({{ "/images/reports/2019-05/website.png#right" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://reproducible-builds.org/)

Chris Lamb added various fixes for larger/smaller screens&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website.git/commit/edef6f8)], added a logo suitable for printing physical pin badges&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website.git/commit/d78fd45)] and refreshed the opening copy text on our [`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/source-date-epoch) page.

Bernhard M. Wiedemann then [documented a more concise C code example](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/source-date-epoch/#c) for parsing the `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` environment variable&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/547732f)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/e1efd6f)] and Holger Levsen added a [link to a specific bug](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1133809) blocking progress in [openSUSE](https://opensuse.org/) to our [*Who is involved?*](https://reproducible-builds.org/who/) page&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/d9f4bce)].
