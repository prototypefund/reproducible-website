* Luca Boccassi [proposed a change](https://salsa.debian.org/salsa-ci-team/pipeline/merge_requests/74) to repotest to not use the `nocheck` option to make more reproducibility issues visible.

The author must provide this information to Mozilla during submission along with instructions on how to reproduce the build.

## Software development

#### Upstream patches

The Reproducible Builds project detects, dissects and attempts to fix as many currently-unreproducible packages as possible. We endeavour to send all of our patches upstream where appropriate. This month, we wrote a large number of such patches, including:

* Bernhard M. Wiedemann:
    * [zip](https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/700402) (add SDE clamping of mtime; [also submitted upstream](https://sourceforge.net/p/infozip/patches/25/) and [distropatches](https://github.com/distropatches/zip/commits/opensuse))
