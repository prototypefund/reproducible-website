## misc

* FIXME: Holger learned about [Reproducible Science is good. Replicated Science is better.](https://rescience.github.io/) from profpatch.

## Distro work

#### Debian

* FIXME: Holger started a new section at https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds#Solved_issues to document progress on Debian.

* FIXME: Holger sponsored an upload of in-toto_0.4.0-1_amd64.changes by Lukas PÃ¼hringer to Debian NEW queue. in-toto_0.4.0-1 ACCEPTED into unstable, 0.4.0-2 MIGRATED to testing.

* FIXME: Holger [restarted the discussion](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=774415#270) on "[#774415](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=774415): devscripts: please add the srebuild wrapper for reproducible builds".

* FIXME: Johannes 'josch' Schauer explained that [mmdebstrap](https://tracker.debian.org/mmdebstrap) can [create bit by bid identical Debian chroots of unstable and buster](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2019/10/msg00101.html), for both the --variant=essential and --variant=minbase variants.

* [bit by bit identical chroot creation](https://alioth-lists.debian.net/pipermail/reproducible-builds/Week-of-Mon-20191007/011759.html)
