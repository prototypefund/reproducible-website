#### Debian

* Rene Engelhard uploaded libreoffice (1:6.4.0~alpha1-0reprotest1) to experimental, with these changes relevant to r-b:
       * debian/rules, debian/tests/control:
         - temporarily disable all languages except en-US,de,he,ja, disable -g
           (and -dbgsym), don't run make check/build the test packages so that we
           hopefully don't timeout in the reproducible builds infrastructure

* Thorsten Glaser filed "#944691: dh: set umask 022 for all operations"

#### Alpine Linux

* FIXME: first reproducible Alpine package: https://mobile.twitter.com/n_copa/status/1192447768855482369

#### Fdroid:

* Holger increased / on osuosl168, our Fdroid build node, by 100G, to cope with the reproducible_fdroid_build_apps job finally succeeding building apps again.

#### Archlinux

* FIXME: the slight green bump on https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/archlinux/archlinux.png is due to the new pacman release. Meta: waiting for Foxboron's blogpost.
