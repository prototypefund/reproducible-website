#### Upstream issues

    * [`OpenSC`](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/pull/1839) (generate consistent docbook id's)

#### Debian

* Rene Engelhard uploaded libreoffice (1:6.4.0~alpha1-0reprotest1) to experimental, with these changes relevant to r-b:
       * debian/rules, debian/tests/control:
         - temporarily disable all languages except en-US,de,he,ja, disable -g
           (and -dbgsym), don't run make check/build the test packages so that we
           hopefully don't timeout in the reproducible builds infrastructure

#### Alpine Linux

* FIXME: first reproducible Alpine package: https://mobile.twitter.com/n_copa/status/1192447768855482369

#### Fdroid:

* Holger increased / on osuosl168, our Fdroid build node, by 100G, to cope with the reproducible_fdroid_build_apps job finally succeeding building apps again.
