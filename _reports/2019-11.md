**Welcome to the November 2019 report from the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) project!**
{: .lead}

[![]({{ "/images/reports/2019-11/reproducible-builds.png#right" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://reproducible-builds.org/)

In these reports we outline the most important things that we have been up over the past month. As a quick recap, whilst anyone can inspect the source code of free software for malicious flaws, almost all software is distributed to end users as pre-compiled binaries.

The motivation behind the reproducible builds effort is to ensure no flaws have been introduced during this compilation process by promising identical results are always generated from a given source, thus allowing multiple third-parties to come to a consensus on whether a build was compromised.

In this month's report, we cover:

* **Media coverage and events** — *Enter the Reproducibility Challenge, etc.*
* **Upstream news** — *OCaml, Mes, Maven, etc.*
* **Distribution work** — *The latest reports from Arch, Debian and openSUSE, etc.*
* **Software development** — *A Christmas bonanza of patches and work on diffoscope, etc.*
* **Contributing** — *How to get in touch&hellip*

If you are interested in contributing to our project, please visit our [*Contribute*]({{ "/contribute/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) page on our website.

## Media coverage and events

***We held our [fifth annual Reproducible Builds summit]({{ "/events/Marrakesh2019/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) between the 1st and 8th December in Marrakesh, Morocco. A full, in-depth report will be posted next month…***

On November 16th, Vagrant Cascadian presented [*There and Back Again, Reproducibly*](https://osem.seagl.org/conferences/seagl2019/program/proposals/671) at the [SeaGL](https://seagl.org) in Seattle, Washington.

[![]({{ "/images/reports/2019-11/themanifest.jpg#right" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://manifest.fm/14)

Chris Lamb was featured on [The Manifest](https://manifest.fm) package management podcast in an episode called [*Reproducible Builds project and Debian package management*](https://manifest.fm/14).

[ReScience C](http://rescience.github.io/) is an open-access journal that targets computational research and encourages the explicit replication of already published research. This month they announced their [*Ten Years Reproducibility Challenge*](https://rescience.github.io/ten-years/) which promotes the idea that old code (in this instance, a "scientific article [published] before January 1st 2010") should also run on modern hardware and software in order to check one can obtain the same scientific results in the future.

## Upstream news

Mike Hommey [pushed a change to Mozilla build system](https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/autoland/rev/cd6b79c74b23) to add and print an error message when differences are found between builds as requested in [bug 1597903](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1597903).

[![]({{ "/images/reports/2019-11/ocaml.png#right" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://ocaml.org/)

There was fresh activity on an old pull request for the [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) programming language regarding the usage and adoption of the [`BUILD_PATH_PREFIX_MAP` environment variable](https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/build-path-prefix-map/) that is used to ensure that software packages do not embed build-time paths into generated files. On [the pull request](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/1515) in question [Gabriel Scherer](http://gallium.inria.fr/~scherer/) was kind [to provide many helpful examples on how to use the rewrite rules](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/1515#issuecomment-559035723).

Jan Nieuwenhuizen [announced the release of GNU Mes 0.21](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2019-November/001725.html) and Jeremiah Orians [announced](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2019-November/001711.html) the release of [mescc-tools-seed](https://github.com/oriansj/mescc-tools-seed) version 1.1:

> Capable of bootstrapping from a simple hex assembler all the way to a cross-platform C compiler  Work is still ongoing [to] result in a full bootstrap from a 357 byte bootstrap binary all the way to GCC.

[![]({{ "/images/reports/2019-11/maven.png#right" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://maven.apache.org/)

[Hervé Boutemy](http://people.apache.org/~hboutemy/) announced the release of three base [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) plugins (source, `.jar`, and assembly) to get reproducible Builds as a direct output from this build system. For more information, please see the ["Configuring for Reproducible Builds"](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-reproducible-builds.html) section of the documentation.

Eli Schwartz reported a bug against the [GNU groff](https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/) typesetting system for incomplete [`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`](https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/) environment variable support [due to its output files embedding the timezone](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?57218).

### Distribution work

#### Arch Linux

[![]({{ "/images/reports/2019-11/archlinux.png#right" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://www.archlinux.org/)

A [slight but temporary decline in the reproducibility status](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/archlinux/archlinux.png) was determined to be due to a bug in the continuous integration framework where one build was building with `--nocheck` whilst the other did not, resulting in the test dependencies being installed on one build. This led to differences in the `BUILDINFO` file which records the build dependencies.

Morten Linderud (*Foxboron*) [wrote a blog post](https://linderud.dev/blog/reproducible-arch-linux-packages/) on the progress of reproducible builds for Arch packages, including how to reproduce packages and a roadmap of future of work.

A lot of work has been put into getting the `[core]` more reproducible; [every package has been rebuilt](https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2019-November/029721.html) with a new version of [pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman) which resolves an issue with storing the package size. Build failures and download issues have also been resolved which have lead to an increase of reproducible packages in the [Arch Linux continuous integration setup](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/archlinux/archlinux.html).

The standard Arch Linux development tools package (`devtools`) now contains a new `makerepropkg` tool which can reproduce a package from the Arch repositories providing a `PKGBUILD` exists in the current working directory.

#### openSUSE

[![]({{ "/images/reports/2019-11/opensuse.png#right" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://www.opensuse.org/)

Bernhard M. Wiedemann posted a [summary of openSUSE updates for 2019](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2019-November/001722.html) including `rpm`, a [high level openSUSE status](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1133809) and fixing [problems with `.pyc` files](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1094323) which is also relevant to Arch Linux.

The report also summarises the current "total" reproducibility status:

[![]({{ "/images/reports/2019-11/opensuse-graph.png#center" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](http://rb.zq1.de/compare.factory/graph.png)

In addition to this, Bernhard also published his [monthly Reproducible Builds status update](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2019-11/msg00370.html).

#### Debian

[![]({{ "/images/reports/2019-11/debian.png#right" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://debian.org/)

[Thorsten Glaser](https://www.mirbsd.org/) [filed a bug against the `debhelper` packaging library](https://bugs.debian.org/944691) to request that it sets and exports a [`umask`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask) of `022` for all operations as a possible "harmonisation potential" — a varying `umask` can result in unreproducible packages as the file permissions on the build system can be embedded into archives generated by the build system.

Chris Lamb categorised a large number of packages and issues in the Reproducible Builds "[notes](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/activity)" repository, including adding a new `ocaml_dune_captures_build_path` toolchain issue&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/c12c8853)].

Vagrant Cascadian filed a big against the [Lintian](https://lintian.debian.org/) Debian package static analyser to request that it [checks for missing and/or unsigned `.buildinfo` files](https://bugs.debian.org/944707). He also [uploaded the latest version](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1080851/accepted-mes-020-1-source-amd64-into-experimental-experimental/) of [GNU Mes](https://www.gnu.org/software/mes/) to the *unstable* distribution.

#### Other

[![]({{ "/images/reports/2019-11/alpine.png#right" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://alpinelinux.org/)

Nationael Copa ([@n_copa](https://twitter.com/n_copa)) posted on Twitter that he was was [finally able to make a fully reproducible package](https://twitter.com/n_copa/status/1192447768855482369)) for the [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/).

The [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) distribution announced that they [plan to run a Christmas Hackathon](https://www.meetup.com/NixOS-London/events/266848767) hosted by [Smarkets](https://smarkets.com/) in London, England on 9th December.

#### [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org)

[![]({{ "/images/reports/2019-10/diffoscope.svg#right" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://diffoscope.org)

diffoscope versions `131`, `132` and `133` was uploaded to Debian unstable by Chris Lamb. Chris also made the following changes:

* New features / improvements:
    * Allow all possible `.zip` file variations to return from external tools with non-zero exit codes, not just known types we can identify (eg. Java `.jmod` and `.jar` files).&nbsp;([#78](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/issues/78))
    * Limit `.dsc` and `.buildinfo` file matching to files in ASCII or UTF-8 format.&nbsp;([#77](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/issues/77))
    * Bump the previous `max_page_size` limit from 400 kB to 4 MB.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/7d6daf7)]
    * Clarify in the HTML and text outputs that the limits are per-format, not global.&nbsp;([#944882](https://bugs.debian.org/944882))
    * Don't use line-base dbuffering when communucating with subprocesses in "binary" mode.&nbsp;([#75](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/issues/75))

* Regression fixes:
    * Correct the substitution/filtering of paths in ELF output to avoid unnecessary differences depending on the path name provided and commandline.&nbsp;([#945572](https://bugs.debian.org/945572))
    * Silence/correct a Python [`SyntaxWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxWarning) message due to incorrectly comparing an integer by identity vs. equality.&nbsp;([#945531](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/ecef7e6))

* Testsuite improvements:
    * Refresh the [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) test fixtures to support versions greater than 4.08.1.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/4754277)]
    * Update an [Android manifest](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro) test to reflect that parsed XML attributes are returned in a new/sorted manner under Python 3.8.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/c01dc80)]
    * Dramatically Truncate the [tcpdump](https://www.tcpdump.org/) expected diff to 8KB from ~600KB to reduce the size of the release tarball.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/9c66d5f)]
    * Add a self-test to encourage that new test data files are generated dynamically or at least no new ones are added without an explicit override.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/1c4b127)]
    * Add a comment that the `text_ascii1` and `text_ascii2` fixture files are used in multiple tests so is not trivial to remove/replace them.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/69a8cc7)]
    * Drop two more test fixture files for the directory tests.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/a0f7a11)]
    * Don't run our self-test against the output of the [Black source code reformatter](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) with versions earlier than "ours" as it will generate different results.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/aefa5a3)]
    * Update an XML test for Python 3.8.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/06d11dd)]

#### strip-nondeterminism

[strip-nondeterminism](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/strip-nondeterminism) is our tool to remove specific non-deterministic results from a completed build. This month, Chris Lamb added `file` as a dependency for `libfile-stripnondeterminism-perl` ([#945212](https://bugs.debian.org/945212)) and moved away from deprecated `$ADTTMP` variable [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/strip-nondeterminism.git/commit/803d5f9)], making two uploads in total (`1.6.2-1` & `1.6.3-1`).

#### Project website

[![]({{ "/images/reports/2019-11/website.png#right" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://reproducible-builds.org/)

There was yet more effort put into our [our website](https://reproducible-builds.org/) this month, including:

* Chris Lamb dropped a duplicated use the term "community" and other words&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website.git/commit/e390fe4)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website.git/commit/7c14c50)], correcting the capitalisation of [GitHub](https://github.com/) & [GitLab](https://gitlab.org/)&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website.git/commit/ae47fcd)] and corrected the use of "an"&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website.git/commit/93fc479)].

* Daniel Edgecumbe added a [section on initramfs and `.cpio` files]({{ "/docs/archives/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}#initramfs-images) to our [Archive Metadata]({{ "/docs/archives/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) page.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/c584cec)]

* Hervé Boutemy added a link to [Maven Guide to Configuring for Reproducible Builds](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-reproducible-builds.html) to [our JVM page]({{ "/docs/JVM/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/93fd259)]

* Jelle van der Waa added [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)-specific links for [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/) etc. to our [Tools]({{ "/docs/tools/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) page.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/0ca7223)]
