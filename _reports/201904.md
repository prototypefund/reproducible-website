* fontconfig
    * The fontconfig developers merged patches to allow font cache files to be reproducible
    * [FIXME](https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/fontconfig/2019-April/006508.html)
    * [FIXME](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/fontconfig/fontconfig/issues/130#note_144421)

* Chris Lamb [updated the certificate](https://github.com/lamby/try.diffoscope.org/commit/aa3cc35451dd7fedfdc30af7b248b39d0e9f7898) of try.diffoscope.org ; FIXME: background/details

* [debian-installer upload](https://bugs.debian.org/920676#50)

* David A. Wheeler published [an essay on the recent `bootstrap-sass` incident](https://dwheeler.com/essays/bootstrap-sass-subversion.html) that proposes reproducible builds as one way to reduce the impact of such software supply chain attacks in the future.

* The first non-trivial library written in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) (on the [JVM](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/jvm/)) was released with Arnout Engelen's [sbt-reproducible-builds](https://github.com/raboof/sbt-reproducible-builds) plugin enabled during the build: [Akka 2.5.22](https://akka.io/blog/news/2019/04/03/akka-2.5.22-released). The artifacts built with version 2.12.8 of the Scala compiler could be [successfully reproduced](https://arnout.engelen.eu/rb/akka/2.12/2.5.22/), those built with version 2.13.0-M5 contained [some inconsistencies](https://arnout.engelen.eu/rb/akka/2.13.0-M5/2.5.22/) due to a compiler issue that already has been [fixed for 2.13.0-RC1](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/7429). The original release was performed on a Mac and it was reproduced on a Debian machine, so the build appears reproducible across diverse systems.

that has been bootstrapped entirely from hex0 with 100% reproducible output/binaries.
