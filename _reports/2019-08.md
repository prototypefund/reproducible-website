## Software development

#### Upstream patches

The Reproducible Builds project detects, dissects and attempts to fix as many currently-unreproducible packages as possible.
We endeavour to send all of our patches upstream where appropriate. This month, we wrote a large number of such patches, including:

* Bernhard M. Wiedemann:
    * [fwupd](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1143905) (report hash over unreproducible LTO data)
    * [kernel-vanilla](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-kernel/2019-08/msg00000.html) (drop number of CPUs)
    * [kernel-obs-build](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-kernel/2019-08/msg00001.html) (date from /etc/shadow)
    * [dracut](https://github.com/dracutdevs/dracut/issues/617) (report CPU influencing build result)
    * [katacontainers-image-initrd/osbuilder](https://github.com/kata-containers/osbuilder/pull/340) (merged ; shell date - new variant with nanoseconds)
    * [buildad](https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/1805) (date)
    * [nethack](https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/722212) (date (not submitted upstream); tar)
    * [python-python3-saml](https://github.com/onelogin/python3-saml/pull/156) (fix FTBFS-2020 - more issues further in the future)
    * [gnutls](https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/merge_requests/1058) (date / copyright year)
    * [pcc](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1146634) (report unreproducibility when building with Link Time Optimization)
    * [libfaketime](https://github.com/wolfcw/libfaketime/issues/183) (toolchain: fix various builds under libfaketime)
    * [python-pytest-httpserver](https://github.com/csernazs/pytest-httpserver/pull/22) (renew SSL certs to fix FTBFS after 2019-09-03)
    * [python-ipyparallel](https://github.com/ipython/ipyparallel/issues/380) (report FTFBS-j1)
    * [sblim-cmpi-base](https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/726294) (Disable parallel make because of broken build system deps)

    * [libchamplain](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libchamplain/merge_requests/9) (path)

#### diffoscope

* Vagrant Cascadian updated to [diffoscope 120](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/commit/?id=c91364d36cf6c8fc4c696d151eb9fca7832cf898) [and 121](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/commit/?id=8c1379ba404b4db2f0afcf431a4ff720b72a7a19) in GNU Guix.

#### libfaketime
A [fix to libfaketime](https://github.com/wolfcw/libfaketime/issues/183) can now help better debug or fix reproducibility issues.

## FIXME

* [FIXME](https://github.com/molior-dbs/molior/issues/3) - molior: use "repeatable build" instead of "reproducible build"

* The first Debian package sets have become 100% reproducible: [Debian essential package set for bullseye/amd64](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/bullseye/amd64/pkg_set_essential.html) and [armhf](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/bullseye/armhf/pkg_set_essential.html). perl still has isses on [i386](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/rb-pkg/bullseye/i386/diffoscope-results/perl.html) and [arm64](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/rb-pkg/bullseye/arm64/diffoscope-results/perl.html)

Bernhard M. Wiedemann posted his [monthly Reproducible Builds status update](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2019-08/msg00186.html) for the [openSUSE](https://opensuse.org/) distribution where new issues were found from enabling [Link Time Optimization](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/LinkTimeOptimization) (LTO) in this distribution's "[Tumbleweed](https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/tumbleweed)" branch. This affected, for example, [nvme-cli](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=91307) as well as [perl-XML-Parser and pcc](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1146634) with packaging issues.

* [FIXME](https://bugs.debian.org/934511)

* [FIXME](https://bugs.debian.org/934405) - a report on how Debian binary non-maintainer uploads influence `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`

* [FIXME](https://github.com/redhotpenguin/perl-Archive-Zip/issues/26#issuecomment-521408412) - perl-Archive-Zip still has broken bzip handling - [affects strip-nondeterminism](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/strip-nondeterminism/issues/1)

* [Hardening the "file" utility for Debian -- nb. paywalled for now but will not be by report publication date](https://lwn.net/Articles/796108)

* [FIXME](https://github.com/skvadrik/re2c/pull/258)

* [FIXME](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/2290#issuecomment-522206365)

* [FIXME](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/issues/unstable/captures_varying_number_of_build_path_directory_components_issue.html)

* [FIXME](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=935127)

* [FIXME](https://www.zdnet.com/article/backdoor-found-in-webmin-a-popular-web-based-utility-for-managing-unix-servers/) + [webmin upstream notice](http://www.webmin.com/exploit.html) / https://lwn.net/Articles/796951/

* [FIXME](https://github.com/redhotpenguin/perl-Archive-Zip/issues/26#issuecomment-524039184)

* FIXME Vagrant Cascadian and Holger Levsen presented "There and Back Again, Reproducibly!" at linuxdev-br.net.

* tests.r-b.o/coreboot fails to build the toolchain since we switched to building on buster, https://jenkins.debian.net/job/reproducible_coreboot/356 was the last successful build, all newer builds fail. Thus https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/coreboot/coreboot.html was last updated on August 7th.

* The fix for https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/pull/2121 has been cherry picked into the git master branch on August 13th as https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/commit/454021581f630d5d04afeb8ff6581c1bda295c87 - this adds feeds.buildinfo and version.buildinfo files as output into the build directory.

* At [CCCamp 2019](https://events.ccc.de/camp/2019) there were once again several discussions and meet-ups at least partly devoted to reproducible builds:
  * [FIXME](https://events.ccc.de/camp/2019/wiki/Session:Reproducible_Builds_Meetup) was attended by around 25 people, half of them were new to the project.
  * [FIXME](https://events.ccc.de/camp/2019/wiki/Session:Arch_Linux_Meetup)
