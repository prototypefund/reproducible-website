**Welcome to the February 2020 report from the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) project!**
{: .lead}


[![]({{ "/images/reports/2020-02/reproducible-builds.png#right" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://reproducible-builds.org/)

In these reports we outline the most important things that we have been up to over the past month. As a quick recap, whilst anyone may inspect the source code of free software for malicious flaws, almost all software is distributed to end users as pre-compiled binaries.

The motivation behind the reproducible builds effort is to ensure no flaws have been introduced during this compilation process by promising identical results are always generated from a given source, thus allowing multiple third-parties to come to a consensus on whether a build was compromised.

In this month's report, we cover:

* **Media coverage & upstream news** — *A new paper on reproducible containers, Ruby updated, etc.*
* **Distribution work** — *More work in Debian, openSUSE & friends*
* **Software development** — *Updates and improvements to our tooling*
* **Getting in touch** — *How to contribute, more venues for discussion*

If you are interested in contributing to the project, please visit our [*Contribute*]({{ "/contribute/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) page on our website.

## Media coverage & upstream news

[![]({{ "/images/reports/2020-02/dettrace.png#right" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://gatowololo.github.io/resources/publications/dettrace.pdf)

[Omar Navarro Leija](https://gatowololo.github.io/), a PhD student at the [University Of Pennsylvania](https://home.www.upenn.edu/), published a paper entitled "[Reproducible Containers](https://gatowololo.github.io/resources/publications/dettrace.pdf)" that describes the workings of a user-space container tool for Linux called *DetTrace*:

> All computation that occurs inside a DetTrace container is a pure function of the initial filesystem state of the container. Reproducible containers can be used for a variety of purposes, including replication for fault-tolerance, reproducible software builds and reproducible data analytics. We use DetTrace to achieve, in an automatic fashion, reproducibility for 12,130 Debian package builds, containing over 800 million lines of code, as well as bioinformatics and machine learning workflows.

There was also considerable [discussion on our mailing list regarding this research](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2020-February/001820.html) and a presentation based on this paper will occur at the [ASPLOS 2020](https://asplos-conference.org/) conference in Lausanne, Switzerland between March 16th — 20th.

Reproducible Builds were touted as a benefit for software compliance in a talk at FOSDEM, debating whether the [Careful Inventory of Licensing Bill of Materials Have Impact of FOSS License Compliance](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/debate_license_compliance/) which pitted [Jeff McAffer](https://twitter.com/jeffmcaffer) and [Carol Smith](https://www.fossygirl.com/) against [Bradley Kuhn](http://ebb.org/bkuhn/). (~47 minutes in).

Vagrant Cascadian reported on [our mailing list](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/listinfo/rb-general/) regarding a [quick reproducible test for the GNU Guix distribution](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2020-February/001810.html), which resulted in 81.9% of packages registering as reproducible in his installation:

    $ guix challenge --verbose --diff=diffoscope ...
    2,463 store items were analyzed:
      - 2,016 (81.9%) were identical
      - 37 (1.5%) differed
      - 410 (16.6%) were inconclusive

[Jeremiah Orians announced on our mailing list](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2020-February/001798.html) the release of a number of tools related to cross-compilation such as [M2-Planet](https://github.com/oriansj/M2-Planet) and [`mescc-tools-seed`](https://github.com/oriansj/mescc-tools-seed). For those not familiar with the project, it is the full bootstrap of a cross-platform compiler for the C programming language (written in C itself) from hex, the ultimate goal being able to demonstrate fully-bootstrapped compiler from hex to the [GCC GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/). This has many implications in and around [Ken Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson)'s [*Trusting Trust*](https://www.archive.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf) attack he outlined in his 1983 [Turing Award Lecture](https://amturing.acm.org/lectures.cfm).

Nobuyoshi Nakada updated the canonical implementation of the [Ruby programming language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) a change such that filesystem [globs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) (ie. calls to list the contents of filesystem directories) will henceforth be [sorted in ascending order](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/8709#note-19). Without this change, the underlying nondeterministic ordering of the filesystem is exposed to the language which often result in an unreproducible build.

Reddit user [`tofflos`](https://www.reddit.com/user/tofflos) posted to the [/r/Java subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/java) asking about how to achieve [reproduciblebuilds with Maven](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/faqadv/reproducible_builds_with_maven/).

Chris Lamb noticed that the Linux kernel documentation about reproducible builds of it is available on the [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org) homepages [in an attractive HTML format](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/kbuild/reproducible-builds.html).

Twitter user [@TheYoctoJester](https://twitter.com/TheYoctoJester) posted an executive summary of reproducible builds in the [Yocto Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/):

## Distribution work

#### [Debian](https://debian.org/)

[![]({{ "/images/reports/2020-02/debian.png#right" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://debian.org/)

Chris Lamb filed a pull request for the core `debian-installer` package to allow all arguments from `sources.list` files (such as `[check-valid-until=no]`) in order that we can test the reproducibility of the installer images on the [Reproducible Builds own testing infrastructure](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/reproducible.html).&nbsp;([#13](https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/debian-installer/-/merge_requests/13))

Thorsten Glaser [followed up to a bug filed against the `dpkg-source` component](https://bugs.debian.org/796257#29) (originally filed in late 2015) that claims that it does not respect permissions when unpacking tarballs if the [umask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask) is set to `0002`.

Matthew Garrett posted to the [`debian-devel` mailing list](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/) on the topic of "[Producing verifiable initramfs images](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2020/02/msg00121.html)", part of a wider conversation on being able to trust the entire software stack on our computers.

59 reviews of Debian packages were added, 30 were updated and 42 were removed this month adding to [our knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html). Many issue types were noticed and categorised by Chris Lamb, including:

* [`openstack_pkg_tools_python_shebang_and_dependencies`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/bebb8e68)
* [`random_argument_handling_in_javatools_jh_build`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/55dcb305)
* [`build_path_in_code_generated_by_dgbus_codegen`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/2757cc3a)
* [`fortran_captures_build_path`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/feef3e6f)
* *etc.*

#### [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/)

[![]({{ "/images/reports/2020-02/opensuse.png#right" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://www.opensuse.org/)

In [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/), Bernhard M. Wiedemann published his [monthly Reproducible Builds status update](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2020-03/msg00014.html) as well as provided the following patches:

* [`python-rpm-macros`](https://github.com/openSUSE/python-rpm-macros/pull/42) (do not save time-based `.pyc` files for tests)
* [`solfege`](https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/778645) (filesystem ordering issue sent upstream via email; package is [orphaned upstream](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?53159))
* [`DVDStyler`](https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/775706) (zip timestamps, [submitted upstream](https://sourceforge.net/p/dvdstyler/DVDStyler/merge-requests/1/))
* [`python-pikepdf`](https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/778615) (recreate unreproducible `.pyc` files)

## Software development

#### [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org)

[![]({{ "/images/reports/2020-01/diffoscope.png#right" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://diffoscope.org)

[*diffoscope*](https://diffoscope.org) is our in-depth and content-aware diff-like utility that can locate and diagnose reproducibility issues. It is run countless times a day on [our testing infrastructure](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/reproducible.html) and is essential for identifying fixes and causes of nondeterministic behaviour.

Chris Lamb made the following changes this month, including uploading version `137` to Debian:

* The `sng` image utility appears to return with an exit code of 1 if there are even minor errors in the file, so allow for that.&nbsp;([#950806](https://bugs.debian.org/950806))
* Also extract `classes2.dex`, `classes3.dex` from `.apk` files.&nbsp;([#88](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/issues/88))
* No need to use `str.format` if we are just returning the string.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/adbd7f7)]
* Add generalised support for "ignoring" returncodes&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/dd23327)] and move special-casing of returncodes in zip to use `Command.VALID_RETURNCODES`.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/ad9100f)]

#### Other tools

*disorderfs* is our [FUSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace)-based filesystem that deliberately introduces non-determinism into directory system calls in order to flush out reproducibility issues. This month, Vagrant Cascadian updated the `Vcs-Git` to specify the `debian` packaging branch.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/disorderfs/commit/bab6d34)]

*reprotest* is our end-user tool to build same source code twice in widely differing environments and then checks the binaries produced by each build for any differences. This month, versions `0.7.13` and `0.7.14` were [uploaded to Debian unstable](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/reprotest) by Holger Levsen after Vagrant Cascadian added support for [GNU Guix](https://guix.gnu.org/)&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reprotest/commit/31bd4fe)].

#### Project documentation & website

[![]({{ "/images/reports/2020-02/website.png#right" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://reproducible-builds.org/)

There was more work performed on [our documentation and website](https://reproducible-builds.org/) this month, including:

* Bernhard M. Wiedemann:

    * Add Java [Gradle Build Tool](https://gradle.org/) snippet to the [`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`]({{ "/docs/SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) documentation.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/93dd5d5)]
    * Normalise various terms to "unreproducible".&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/3998506)]

* Chris Lamb:

    * Add a [Meson.build](https://mesonbuild.com/) example&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/433f91f)] and improve the documentation for [CMake](https://cmake.org/)&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/6c0c999)] to the [`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`]({{ "/docs/SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) documentation.
    * Replace "anyone can" with "anyone may" as, well, not everyone has the resources, skills, time or funding to actually do this.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/0ddf47d)]
    * Improve the pre-processing for our report generation.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/bd6bbe1)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/964052a)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/40b354d)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/6b727d0)] etc.

In addition, Holger Levsen updated our [news page]({{ "/docs/news/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) to improve the list of reports&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/35f17c3)], added an explicit mention of the weekly news time span&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/9922a08)] and revert sorting of entries to have latest on top to match the rest of this page&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/2187cee)] and Mattia Rizzolo added [Codethink](https://www.codethink.co.uk/) as a non-fiscal sponsor&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/11406ea)] and Tianon Gravi added a [Docker Images](https://debuerreotype.github.io/) link underneath the "Debian" project on our "[Projects]({{ "/who/" | prepend: site.baseurl }})" page&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/691f971)].

#### Upstream patches

The Reproducible Builds project detects, dissects and attempts to fix as many currently-unreproducible packages as possible. We endeavour to send all of our patches upstream where appropriate. This month, we wrote a large number of such patches, including:

#### Testing framework

[![]({{ "/images/reports/2019-10/testframework.png#right" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/)

We operate a fully-featured and comprehensive [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)-based testing framework that powers [tests.reproducible-builds.org](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org). This month, the following changes were made:

* Holger Levsen:

    * [Debian](https://debian.org/):

        * Configured an instance of David Bremner's [`builtin-pho`](https://salsa.debian.org/bremner/builtin-pho/) database of `.buildinfo` files. This has resulted in so that we now know that [Debian bullseye contains 4,557 source packages for the `amd64` architecture without corresponding `.buildinfo` files](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/bullseye/amd64/index_no_buildinfos.html) and [25,668 source packages with `.buildinfo` files](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/bullseye/amd64/index_buildinfos.html).&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/fd3d4620)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/b78a784e)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/26db0a3a)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/81993e7a)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/c733ee1d)]
        * Forward mails addressed to `buildinfo@` to the `root` user.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/b26a4a98)]
        * Temporarily revert using backports&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/427ca05c)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/71c2bf83)] and use `devscripts` from buster-backports&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/3d72168d)].
        * Update URL for [PureOS](https://www.pureos.net/) package set.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/a13affc8)]
        * Deprioritise the scheduling of older old packages in *bullseye* and *unstable*.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/89a95738)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/89830eca)]
        * Treat the *bullseye* distribution like *unstable* when scheduling i386, to allow the latter to catch up a bit.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/4608f60e)]

    * Misc/other:

        * Disable the last active [Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org/) builder too for now.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/ebda0872)]
        * Improve generated HTML output.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/561184b2)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/0c24ca70)]
        * Ignore [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) jobs.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/56d1ed08)]
        * Include links to failed and "unstable" jobs in HTML output.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/302122e3)]
        * Start weighting job importance and five a lot more weight to nodes acting as a proxy for others.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/19c2338b)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/69d0e001)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/23437d83)]
        * Add new job to calculate the overall system health for [tests.reproducible-builds.org](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/) for usage with [Jelle van der Waa](https://vdwaa.nl/)'s [Reproducible Builds status display](https://github.com/jelly/reproduciblebuilds-display).&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/aaca6d46)]

[![]({{ "/images/reports/2020-02/reprobuilds-display.jpeg#center" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://github.com/jelly/reproduciblebuilds-display)

* Mattia Rizzolo:

    * Add an [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) web server redirect for [buildinfos.debian.net](https://buildinfos.debian.net/).&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/c4f3448a)]
    * Revert the reshuffling of `arm64` architecture builders.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/1e0109c3)]

As usual, various node maintenance (mostly outside git)was performed by Mattia Rizzolonbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/0f42cb5c)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/51f0aeca)], Vagrant Cascadian and Holger Levsen

This month's report was written by Bernhard M. Wiedemann, Chris Lamb and Holger Levsen. It was subsequently reviewed by a bunch of Reproducible Builds folks on IRC and the mailing list.
