[Salsa](https://salsa.debian.org) is the name of the collaborative development server for [Debian](https://debian.org/) based on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/). *Salsa* provides the necessary tools for package maintainers, packaging teams and other individuals and groups for collaborative development.

The Reproducible Builds project is using *Salsa* to host most of its infrastructure and Git repositories and you can find out more information about Salsa on the [Salsa](https://wiki.debian.org/Salsa) page of the [Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/).

### 5. Join the *Reproducible Builds* group

On *Salsa*, development is split into groups. You will need to join the [reproducible-builds](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds) group before you can commit directly to our Git repositories. You can, however, submit [merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/) without this step.

To join the *Reproducible Builds* group, ensure you are logged into *Salsa*, visit **[salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds)** and then select **Request Access**:

After requesting access, you should see the following message:

### 6. Wait for confirmation

Unfortunately you will have to wait for someone on the Reproducible Builds team to accept your request. You should receive an email once this occurs:

### 7. Add an SSH key

Finally, to push directly to our Git repositories you will need to add your SSH key to your *Salsa* account settings. You can do this by visiting **[salsa.debian.org/profile/keys](https://salsa.debian.org/profile/keys)**:

Congratulations, you are now part of the *Reproducible Builds* group on *Salsa* and you should now be able to clone and push to our repositories via Git.
