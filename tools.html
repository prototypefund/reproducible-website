<p>
  Several tools are available to make your life easier when working on
  <em>reproducible builds</em>.
  <a href="http://reproducible.alioth.debian.org/releases/">Signed tarballs are available</a>.
</p>

<h3>diffoscope</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://diffoscope.org/">diffoscope</a> will try to <strong>get
  to the bottom of what makes files or directories different</strong>. It
  will recursively unpack archives of many kinds and transform various
  binary formats into more human-readable forms for comparison. It can
  compare two tarballs, ISO images, or PDFs just as easily.
</p>
<p>
  See an <a href="https://diffoscope.org/examples/igerman98_20131206-5.txt">example text output</a>.
</p>
<p>
  diffoscope is also <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/diffoscope">available on PyPI</a>.
</p>

<h3>trydiffoscope</h3>
<p>
  If you wish to just experiment with
  <a href="https://diffoscope.org/">diffoscope</a> without installing a large
  number of run-time dependencies, you can use the
  <a href="https://try.diffoscope.org/">try.diffoscope.org</a> service directly
  from your web browser. A lightweight command-line client is also
  <a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/diffoscope">available in Debian</a> and
  <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/trydiffoscope">on PyPI</a>.
</p>


<h3>disorderfs</h3>
<p>
  Problems with <a href="/docs/stable-inputs/">unstable order of inputs</a>
  or other variations introduced by filesystems can sometimes be hard to track down.
  <a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/disorderfs">disorderfs</a> is
  <strong>an overlay FUSE filesystem that deliberately introduces
  non-determinism into filesystem metadata</strong>. For example, it can
  randomize the order in which directory entries are read.
</p>

<h3>strip-nondeterminism</h3>
<p>
  Some tools used in build systems might introduce non-determinism in ways
  difficult to fix at the source, which <strong>requires
  post-processing</strong>. <a
  href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/strip-nondeterminism">strip-nondeterminism</a>
  knows how to <strong>normalize various file formats</strong> such as gzipped files, ZIP
  archives, and Jar files. It is written in Perl with extensibility in
  mind.
</p>

<h3>reprotest</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/reprotest">reprotest</a> builds
  the same source code in different environments and then checks the
  binaries produced by the builds to see if changing the environment,
  without changing the source code, changed the generated binaries.
