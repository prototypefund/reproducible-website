From an email sent to the list on 12/16/2016:
    
Hello there!

Here’s a WIP preview of what will soon/eventually be available at [http://bootstrappable.org](http://bootstrappable.org) (once the domain has been assigned and
mapped).  It’s the website for our new “bootstrappable builds” project
that was born during the Reproducible Builds summit 2016
(i.e. yesterday).

Thanks to all the prolific writers in the bootstrapping sessions who
contributed so much eloquent prose!  (All mistakes and omissions are
mine.)

This is currently running on a weak box in my living room, so please be
gentle with traffic:

    http://bootstrappable.elephly.net

Until we get proper code hosting (already arranged for, just waiting)
the code for the website is available here:

    http://git.elephly.net/software/bootstrappable.org.git

Comments and patches are very welcome!
