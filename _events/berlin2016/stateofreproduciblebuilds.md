## almost done
 * R-B the idea, the goal
 * 92% reproducible in Debian (2015: 83%, 2014: ~60%) when building in same buildpath
 * fully reproducible bitcoin, tor, coreboot, electrobsd, webconverger
 * communication channels setup: mailing list, IRC, webpage
 * test.r-b.o Debian
 * SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH specified, patches in gcc
 * diffoscope version one (already useful)
 * initial prototype of reprotest
 * buildinfo for Debian
 * Monthly IRC meetings
 * 2 summits, community
 * Weekly report (blog, RSS)
 * dpkg+toolchain in Debian main
 * 500 patches merged in Debian, +100 in openSUSE


## half-done / in progress
 * definition of r-b
 * 77% reproducible in Debian (with build-path issue), 23% = 2000-5000 source packages missing
 * Talks, presentations given
 * advocacy / use cases
 * r-b for NetBSD, Archlinux, openSUSE, FreeBSD, Fedora, CEDE, Debian, F-droid
 * SOURCE_PREFIX_MAP specification / GCC build path patches
 * Diffoscope improvements
 * buildinfo for rpm, freebsd, coreboot
 * buildinfo distribution for DAK (Debian FTP)
 * general buildinfo spec
 * rpm support
 * tests.r-b.o * (for everything non-Debian)
 * reproducible live-media, containers, other images
 * Documentation
 * GNU coding guidelines / Debian Policy
 * 800 patches unmerged (in Debian)
 * r-b logo

## Not started / in planning
 * User controls + verification
 * Gettext (reproducible translated content)
 * r-b for Android, OpenBSD, Ubuntu, Redhat
 * buildinfo file distribution (putting them on mirrors/blockchain/public-signed-logs)
 * analyze buildinfo files (detect dirty build envs, find differing binaries, find same binaries even though differing envs)
 * tests.r-b.o / * against the 'real world' (i.e. what is distributed to users)
 * compiler bootstrapping
 * cross distro issue-notes
 * pkgsrc (NetBSD & more)
 * IoT (software running in cars, fridges etc)
 * Windows (except ducible)
 * MacOS + iOS
 * Formal RFC
 * policy & laws
 * r-b book "r-b for Dummies", "Everything you wanted to know about r-b but were too afraid to ask"
