### who is here?

- 1 freebsd person 
- 1 openwrt/coreboot
- many debian people
- 1 tails person

## SUMMARY OF TODOS/MINUTES

1. tests.reproducible-builds.org test setup
* get ride of iframes -- talking to "u" about it

2. reproducing testing set up
* vagrant can try setting up a test set up for the builders themselves, then freebsd can try to replicate the same environments
* lynsis: document how to build openwrt2 -- change the openwrt script and coreboot script so that is doesn't depend on debian
* tails will make a link of the results of testing tails iso so we can link from tests.r-b.org

3. merge the postgres code and create new schema
* change to postgres
* make a script to update schema design

4. notes
* cross distro notes?
* way to mark a package as fixed in notes, and not display them?
* ways to specific whether issue is debian specific

5. making the database schema more cross distro friendly
* CPE -- unique identifier / match names of packages across distros

6. other people doing reproducible tests and reporting back
* Holger wants them to provide yaml files
* lynxis thinks kernelci.org is cool -- has an API for accepting results of kernel builds and boots


## raw minutes

* the other project problems using jenkins test set up
  * cannot reproduce the test set up?
  * simpler to replicate the jenkins test environment -- too many debian dependencies?
  * bash scripts long and complicated -- maybe break out important parts so less intimidating to other potential contributors?

* debian test.reproducible-builds.org
  * get rid of iframes
  * the present group less interested in talking about usability

* scripts for creating different environments for projects (Aspirational)
  * debian
--> hopefully build once and compare against the debian archive
  * one freebsd person / fedora
--> system.d container
  * one openwrt/coreboot
--> build on debian

* lots and lots of talk about wanting to test jenkins
* what can we do right now:
  * external test set up to feed to postgres
  * jernalci project? linux kernel testing? hardware set up for reporting things back? make can use similar style api?
  * other job: maybe create yaml and send tests.r-b.org to display. like tails? tails is builing iso twice and producing diffoscope result

### TAILS:
*  at some point tails will give link to redirect the tails test page 

### DEBIAN: 
* compare the builds to the debian builders
* NOTES / YAML file
  * want: cross distro notes
  * currently SOME notes are debian specific
  * CPE -- match names of packages across distros -- unique idenfier of a package.
