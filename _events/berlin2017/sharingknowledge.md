Participants gathered in small groups. The talking points suggested for their discussion were:

* If you attended one or both of the two previous Summits, which were your experience and takeaways?
* Ask Me Anything: Ask any question you have about repoducible builds
* How do you think reproducible builds are already working well today, and where do you see that there is still work to be done?
