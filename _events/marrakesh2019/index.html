	  - a few more words about the venue, Priscilla, Queen of the Medina
	  - some better photos
	  - explain venue is more like a youth hotel, though there are 10 beds in 5 rooms in the guesthouse next door. (the other 20 beds are in-house.
	  - suggest alternate accomodation options nearby. There are plenty.
	  - mention day-trip option
	  - quick poll, decide in a two weeks or three? (better than rushed in a week)
	  - explain costs, offer to take them, still ask people to contribute financially if possible
		350e per week & person, that's 50e for accom & food & venue per day
		so ask for 300e from people staying elsewhere (its also ok if they pay nothing or less)
