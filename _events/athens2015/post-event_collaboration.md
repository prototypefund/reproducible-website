*50-minute session on day 2*

benefits from collaboration
---------------------------

 - learning from each other
 - not duplicating the work (not reinventing the wheel, like producing identical tools, debugging the same issues again)
 - larger userbase that gets exposed to reproducible builds (good for shaking out bugs)
 - different communities coming together can help to think out-of-the-box
 - sharing infrastructure

what do we have
---------------

 - webserver (reproducible-builds) holger, lunar
 - git repo there, too
 - jenkins setup (debian, arch linux, coreboot, openwrt, netbsd, freebsd (fedora) (qubes)) profitbricks
 - mailing lists
 - twitter account (ReproBuilds)

issues and challenges in collaboration (competitive advantages)
---------------------------------------------------------------

 - specific project information too specific
 - making clear what we are doing (making people not being unwelcome, though):
 - "Reproducible builds are bit-for-bit identical"

concerns that need to get addressed
-----------------------------------

 - use of infrastructure (emptiness of mailing lists)!?
 - address problems when they occur

misc
----

 - disentangling the debian and reproducible-builds things that are more general (non-Debian)
 - every project has its own project mailing list and general questions go to the general one
 - reproducible-athens -> reproducible-builds IRC
 - bi-annual meeting!?; more open the next time
 - session for organizing the next meeting, getting it distributed on more shoulders
