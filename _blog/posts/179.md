Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday September 23 and Saturday September 29 2018:

* Another reminder that the **fourth Reproducible Builds summit will take place in December 11th—13th 2018** at [Mozilla](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Paris)'s offices in Paris, France. If you are interested in attending please register by sending an email to `holger@layer-acht.org`. More details may be found on the [associated event page](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/paris2018/).

* Holger Levsen is requesting review and comments on [a multi-project syntax notes proposal](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/blob/multi-project-syntax/README). He hopes to implement this in the next few weeks.

* [A pull request was proposed](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/9607) to [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython) to ensure [`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`](https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/) only influences the default type of `.pyc` files (yet does not enforce it).

* [Guillem Jover](https://www.hadrons.org/~guillem/) uploaded [dpkg 1.19.1 to Debian unstable](https://tracker.debian.org/news/989886/accepted-dpkg-1191-source-into-unstable/), adding support for dumping database package records in alphabetical order in order to provide reproducible `status` and `available` database files, and further make it possible to output other "[deb822](https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/dpkg-dev/deb822.5.en.html)"-formatted data in a deterministic way. In addition, the `Dpkg::Vendor::Debian` library gained support for a reproducibility-related `fixfilepath` feature.

* Jelle van der Waa [started a TODO list](https://www.archlinux.org/todo/imagemagicks-convert-not-reproducible-in-pkgbuilds/) to fix unreproducible `PKGBUILD` files in [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) which use the [Imagemagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) graphics library's `convert(1)` utility for image manipulation which embeds the `date:create` and `date:modify` file headers.

* `disorderfs` version `0.5.4-1` (our [FUSE](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse)-based filesystem that deliberately introduces non-determinism into filesystem metadata) was [uploaded to Debian unstable](https://tracker.debian.org/news/989895/accepted-disorderfs-054-1-source-amd64-into-unstable/) by Chris Lamb. It included a number of contributions [covered previously](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/disorderfs/commits/debian/0.5.4-1).

* A fix to ensure to that [fontconfig](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fontconfig/) — a library for configuring and customizing font access — [landed in Debian unstable](https://bugs.debian.org/864082#96) (via upstream).

* Chris Lamb added four Debian package reviews. In addition, three were updated and 11 were removed in this week, adding to [our knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html).

* Bernhard M. Wiedemann discovered problems from [arch-dependent `noarch` packages](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1109534) in [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/); there are actually over 1,000 of these.

diffoscope development
----------------------

[diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/) (our in-depth "diff-on-steroids" utility which helps us diagnose reproducibility issues in packages) was [updated in Debian unstable](https://tracker.debian.org/news/989165/accepted-diffoscope-102-source-into-unstable/) by Mattia Rizzolo. It included [contributions already covered in previous weeks](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commits/102) but also included new changes from:

* Chris Lamb:
    * [Strip trailing whitespace from `ssconvert(1)` output to support gnumeric 1.12.43](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/e9d3062),

* Mattia Rizzolo:
    * [Ignore continuous-integration failures in Debian testing](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/7f9f0ac).
    * [Adapt tests to the output of gnumeric 1.12.43](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/ef5ae49).
    * [In Debian, list `liblz4-tool` as an alternative to the lz4 package](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/89e7e67).


Test framework development
--------------------------

There were a huge number of updates to our [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)-based testing framework that powers [tests.reproducible-builds.org](tests.reproducible-builds.org) by Holger Levsen this month, including:

* [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)-specific changes:

    * [Detect failure to download from Git repositories](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/9d91a3fb).
    * Perform a [`chown(1)` call on the build directory to the `build2` user](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/30d9ce83) to ensure it becomes writeable.
    * [Announce summary of scheduled packages again](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/41620d4a).

    * [Ignore long-living schroots in maintenance job](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/1ff6d6ec) which was finding old schroots by accident.
    * [Correctly detect and report if pacman cannot lock its database](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/0810f04c).
    * [Detect "The requested URL returned error: 504" (gateway timeout)](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/0be9051e) build failures.

    * [Create a job to update Archlinux webpages every thirty minutes](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/0bc16c61) as well as [create links between pages](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/777ffcdf).
    * [Use the `${PKG_ID}` variable consistently](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/e9d77190)

* [Debian GNU/Linux](https://www.debian.org/)-specific changes:

    * [Extend the `check_node_is_up()` utility](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/72a6c362). This ensures that nodes not accidentally marked as offline
    * [Set `man-db/auto-update` debconf to false and configure `dpkg` to use the `force-unsafe-io` flag](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/82e2d938) to speed up builds.

* Misc changes:

    * Shorten IRC messages ([1](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/ba3eaa65) & [2](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/f76ce377)).
    * Provide overviews of [monthly](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/4a8a2e23) graphs from [Munin](http://munin-monitoring.org/) as well as [yearly](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/34df443b).

    * [Add notes about which tables Debian is using](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/cc7db6f7) as some might be useful for Arch Linux too.
