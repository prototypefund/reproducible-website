* [fontconfig fix landed in Debian](https://bugs.debian.org/864082)

* FIXME: Guillem uploaded dpkg 1.19.1 with these changes relevant for Reproducible Debian:
  * Dump database package records in alphabetical order. This will give
    reproducible status and available database files, and make it possible
    to output other deb822 formatted data in a deterministic way.
  * Dpkg::Vendor::Debian: Add fixfilepath support to reproducible feature.

* Jelle van der Waa started a [To Do list](https://www.archlinux.org/todo/imagemagicks-convert-not-reproducible-in-pkgbuilds/) to fix unreproducible PKGBUILD's in Arch Linux which use imagemagick's convert for image conversion which embeds the date:create and date:modify.
