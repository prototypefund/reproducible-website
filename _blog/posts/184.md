**If you're interested in attending the Reproducible Builds summit in Paris between 11th—13th December please see [our the event page](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/paris2018/).** In the meantime, here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday October 21 and Saturday October 27 2018:

In the meantime, here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday October 28 and Saturday November 3 2018:

* Vagrant Cascadian has [probed the Debian package archives](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-October/001239.html) found that in current Debian Sid, 88 out of the 154 packages (57%) of the Debian binary packages installed in a minimal system can be verifiably reproduced.

  For a long time, 25,561 out of 27,427 (93%) of the total source packages in the Debian archive have been known to be [reproducible in a our testing environment](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/buster/index_suite_amd64_stats.html). While 57% is a lower figure it could be considered a more substantial statistic as it is not a measure of packages that behave well under carefully controlled conditions but of "real world" Debian artifacts that are installed on end-user systems.

* On Tuesday 6th November, Chris Lamb [will host a seminar](http://talks.cam.ac.uk/talk/index/114232) at the William Gates Building at the University of Cambridge on reproducible builds as part of the [Computer Laboratory NetOS Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/).

* Félix Sipma [submitted a merge request](https://salsa.debian.org/go-team/packages/dh-golang/merge_requests/6) to the [Debian "Go" build tools](https://salsa.debian.org/go-team/packages/dh-golang) to support the `-trimpath=all=` argument which should fix the reproducibility of `restic` as well the categorised [`randomness_in_binaries_generated_by_golang_issue`](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/issues/unstable/randomness_in_binaries_generated_by_golang_issue.html) toolchain issue.

* disorderfs (our [FUSE](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse)-based filesystem that deliberately introduces non-determinism into filesystems) was updated by Bernhard M. Wiedemann to rename test files to `test\_` to make them easier to iterate over ([[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/disorderfs/commit/cde568c)]) and moving the test execution logic into `Makefile` to not require a separate script ([[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/disorderfs/commit/f587ed1)]). After this, Chris Lamb tidied the `Makefiles` ([[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/disorderfs/commit/0232051)]).

* Eelco Dolstra — the BFDL of [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) — gave a presentation on the [future roadmap of NixOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M6yvJC00J4), referencing reproducible builds.

* Chris Lamb noticed that the webpages for the [CLIP OS](https://clip-os.org/) project which aims to build a "hardened, multi-level operating system based on the Linux kernel" [lists bit-for-bit reproducibility in its security roadmap](https://docs.clip-os.org/clipos/security.html#bit-exact-reproducible-builds). ([via LWN](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/768819/63f750a55b508108/))

* 59 Debian package reviews were added, 7 were updated and 17 were removed in this week, adding to [our knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html). Chris Lamb updated one issue type ([`randomness_in_binaries_generated_by_golang`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/16748a15)) and two were added ([`dc_created_timestamp_in_javadoc`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/4e0e4a81) & [`randomness_in_fonts_created_by_fontcustom`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/f9c5dc1d)).

* Holger Levsen updateded our website to add in-toto & Google's participation for [upcoming Paris Summit](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/paris2018/). ([1](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/9f40e5c) & [2](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/a97c843))

* [Molly de Blanc](http://deblanc.net/) forwarded [a call for applications](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-November/001247.html) for the [Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society](https://cyber.harvard.edu/) in Cambridge, Massachusetts class of fellows who do research around the intersection of the internet, society, technology, etc. which may be relevant to anyone speaking, thinking, and writing around the implications of Reproducible Builds.

* There were a number of updates to our [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)-based testing framework that powers [tests.reproducible-builds.org](tests.reproducible-builds.org) by Holger Levsen this month, mostly fighting the load introduced from a number of bots (eg. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/d02a5512)]) but also enhancing the performance of Jenkins via adjusting Java's garbage collection and heap size settings (eg. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/9a1f15b3)]).

We've been experiencing a much too high load on jenkins.debian.net in the last week, as we have experienced some weeks ago as well, after a jenkins plugin update. However, this time Holger has not been able to get this under control again yet. As such, some tests results are delayed currently.

This week's edition was written by Chris Lamb, David A. Wheeler, Holger Levsen & reviewed by a bunch of Reproducible Builds folks on IRC & the mailing lists.
