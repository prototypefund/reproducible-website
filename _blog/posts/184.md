* Vagrant Cascadian then used a simple script and found that in the current Debian as delivered (now that some .buildinfo data is available) 57% of the packages installed in a minimal system are verifiably reproducible (88 reproducible and 66 unreproducible). This is a major step forward, as this is not a measure of special reproducible builds created "on the side", but of the actual "real world" Debian packages.
