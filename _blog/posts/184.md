* Vagrant Cascadian has now [probed the Debian package archives][https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-October/001239.html] with a simple script and found that in current Debian Sid, **57% of the real-world Debian binary packages installed in a minimal system are verifiably reproduceable** (and have been reproduced). This is 88 out of 154 packages.  For a long time, over 93% of all source packages in the Debian archive (25561 out of 27427) have been known to be [reproducible in a laboratory environment](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/buster/index_suite_amd64_stats.html). While 57% is a lower figure, it is a more substantial statistic: it is not a measure of packages that behave well under carefully controlled conditions, but of actual "real world" Debian artifacts that get installed on end-user systems. It is these "real world" artifacts that have successfully been reproduced in the field by this measure. Furthermore, this statistic only considers essential core packages that are installed on all Debian systems - that is, the most important packages.  This is a significant achievement.
