* FIXME Allan McRae <allan@archlinux.org> released https://git.archlinux.org/pacman.git/tag/?h=v5.1.0 with many new features including
              - makepkg:
                - Reproducible build support. makepkg now respects environment
                  SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH when creating package metadata, and unifies
                  source file timestamps to match
                - add more info to .BUILDINFO to aid in reproducing the build
                  environment of a package
                - add --printsrcinfo flag to print SRCINFO file for a PKGBUILD
                - record build information in a .BUILDINFO file
 This means future Archlinux packages builds can be reproducible!

* [< Elio> Just to keep you updated with the latest news with the R-B logo and styleguide: We have the styleguide almost finished so you will have the results very soon, including CSS, guidelines and similar](IRC)

* FIXME: Alioth is gone, welcome Salsa. the reproducible builds group on alioth had 83 members, the project on salsa only 14â€¦

* [Arch Linux starts a rebuild to include BUILDINFO files in every package in their repository for being able to reproduce packages](https://www.archlinux.org/todo/buildinfo-rebuild/). On Arch Linux see *man BUILDINFO* for the contents of this file.

* [Holger posted to debian-devel ask about packages which have not been rebuilt since December 2016](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2018/05/msg00499.html)
