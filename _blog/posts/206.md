Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday March 31 and Saturday April 6 2019:

* Bernhard M. Wiedemann wrote blog post about his [import of openSUSE Tumbleweed into IPFS](https://lizards.opensuse.org/2019/04/03/experimental-opensuse-mirror-via-ipfs/) to aid verification of older binaries.

* [Chris Lamb](https://chris-lamb.co.uk/) filed a wishlist bug against the Debian [`jenkins.debian.org`](http://bugs.debian.org/jenkins.debian.org) "[psuedo-package](https://www.debian.org/Bugs/pseudo-packages)" to request that we test and ensure the reproducibility status of [Debian Installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/) images.

* [Holger Levsen](http://layer-acht.org/thinking/) requested permission for [Diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/) version 113 to enter the upcoming Debian *buster* release via bug [#926065](https://bugs.debian.org/926065). This was subsequently processed by Jonathan Wiltshire.

* [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/) is our in-depth "diff-on-steroids" utility which helps us diagnose reproducibility issues in packages. This week Chris Lamb changed the behaviour such that specifying "`-`" (a hyphen) is explicitly required on the command-line to read a single diff from standard input to avoid somewhat non-intuitive behaviour when *diffoscope* is called without any arguments.&nbsp;[[#54](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/issues/54)]

* 33 reviews of Debian packages were added, 2 were updated and 8 were removed in this week adding to [our knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html). Chris Lamb identifier and triaged a fresh toolchain issue, [`randomness_in_perl6_precompiled_libraries`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/b718ab29).

* There were a number of updates to the [reproducible-builds.org project website](https://reproducible-builds.org), including Chris Lamb adding an explicit link to the "[who]({{ "/who/" | prepend: site.baseurl }})" and "[donate]({{ "/donate/" | prepend: site.baseurl }})" pages in the new footer template [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/2d14946)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/7a95a81)] as well as tidying thelanguage a little[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/7a222f0)]. In addition, Daniel Shahaf adding an April's Fools joke [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/68f4b00)].

* On our [mailing list](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/), David Wheeler started a thread regarding the [definition of reproducibility](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2019-April/001523.html) and how it appears on the [reproducible-builds.org project website](https://reproducible-builds.org).

* Chris Lamb updated the [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) SSL certificate for [buildinfo.debian.net](https://buildinfo.debian.net).

* On the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/) blog, [Pamela Chestek](https://chesteklegal.com/) wrote a post titled "[Do You Know Where Your Code Came From?](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2019/apr/04/nosource-nosecurity/) which references the Reproducible Builds project. In addition,Reproducible Builds (and supply chain security in general) were mentioned on [episode 15 of the LibreLounge podcast](https://librelounge.org/episodes/episode-15-at-libre-planet-with-sean-obrien.html).
