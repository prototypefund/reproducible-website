Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday June 10 and Saturday June 16 2018:

* Tom Yates published a post titled [*Toward a fully reproducible Debian*](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/757118/f2f894279576c348/) on [LWN](https://lwn.net/) based on Chris Lamb's keynote presentation at [FLOSSUK 2018](https://www.flossuk.org/membership/spring-conference-2018/) in Edinburgh, Scotland earlier this year.

* On Wednesday 13th June, Chris Lamb presented at [foss-backstage.de](https://foss-backstage.de) in Berlin, Germany on reproducible builds and [how they prevent developers being targets for malicious attacks](https://foss-backstage.de/session/think-youre-not-target-tale-3-developers) ([links](https://reproducible-builds.org/resources/)).

* Elio Qoshi of [Ura Design](https://ura.design) wrote about the new [reproducible builds style guide on their blog](https://ura.design/2018/06/13/reproducible-builds-styleguide) ([preview](https://reproducible-builds.org/style/)).

* Chris Lamb made a number of changes to the [reproducible-builds.org website](https://reproducible-builds.org/) including [importing presentations from the Debian wiki](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/ae834c4), [adding a missing SEAGL talk](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/957437a) and [updating the contribution page to link to our Debian Installer tracking issue](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/cdc53fb).

* [Paul Wise](http://bonedaddy.net/pabs3/) filed Debian bug [#901300](https://bugs.debian.org/901300) (*bls: warn about strip-nondeterminism output in build logs*) requesting that the scanner detects when `strip-nondeterminism` locates some non-determinism and warn about it in the build logs.

* Chris Lamb filed a wishlist bug [#901473](https://bugs.debian.org/901473) to request that the [Reproducible Builds testing framework](http://tests.reproducible-builds.org/) varies on a [merged `/usr`](https://wiki.debian.org/UsrMerge) when comparing packages.

* This week, 15 package reviews were added, 16 were updated and 19 were removed adding to our [knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html).

* `strip-nondeterminism` version `0.042-1` was [uploaded to Debian unstable](https://tracker.debian.org/news/965305/accepted-strip-nondeterminism-0042-1-source-all-into-unstable/) by Chris Lamb. It [included contributions already covered in previous weeks](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/strip-nondeterminism/commits/debian/0.042-1) as well as new ones from, [respect `nocheck` build profile in `DEB_BUILD\OPTIONS`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/strip-nondeterminism/commit/9e084a0).

[diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org) is our in-depth "diff-on-steroids" utility which helps us diagnose reproducibility issues in packages.
