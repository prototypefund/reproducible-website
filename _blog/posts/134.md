Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday November 12 and Saturday November 18 2017:

Past and upcoming events
------------------------

We plan to hold [an assembly at 34C3](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/wiki/index.php/Assembly:Reproducible-Builds) - hope to see you there!

On November 17th Chris Lamb presented at the [Open Compliance Summit](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-compliance-summit/) in Yokohama, Japan on how reproducible builds can ensure the long-term sustainability of technology infrastructure.


GSoC and Outreachy updates
--------------------------

We are pleased to announce that [Juliana Oliveira R (jwnx) will be mentored by
Mattia Rizzolo](https://www.outreachy.org/alums/) on Reproducible Builds /
diffoscope in this round of [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/')!


Reproducible work in other projects
-----------------------------------

* [Tails](https://tails.boum.org) announced that they were proud to present Tails 3.3 as one of the "[world's first reproducible ISO images](https://tails.boum.org/news/reproducible_Tails/)".

* [Support for SOURCE\_DATE\_EPOCH in the \pdftrailerid command](http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2017-November/040794.html) of [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) was merged.

* Pierre Pronchery (`khorben`) [submitted a patch to build pkgsrc packages reproducibly](http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-pkg/2017/11/12/msg019018.html).

* The Google Container Tools team [announced the release of container-diff](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/11/container-diff-for-comparing-container-images.html), a new project to help uncover differences between container images.


Bootstrapping and Diverse Double Compilation
--------------------------------------------

Work on bootstrapping also made progress in
[MesCC](https://gitlab.com/janneke/mes) from Jan Nieuwenhuizen. MesCC now
compiles a less heavily patched TinyCC into a `mes-tcc` which passes 41/69
of mescc's C tests.


Qt tests and `__FILE__`
-----------------------

Our [patched
GCC](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_repositories.html) that
we use for testing Debian unstable has uncovered an interesting issue with
certain Qt [build-time test
suites](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=876901). The issue is
that test suites using `QFINDTESTDATA` depend on `__FILE__` to expand to
something that may be reused after compilation as a real filesystem path when
starting from the same working directory as the original compilation.

However, this behaviour is not explicitly guaranteed by formal documentation
about `__FILE__`, and thus when it is rewritten to be build-path-independent (by
a combination of our patched dpkg and GCC), the Qt tests break because their
usage is no longer expanded to a real path as they expected.

Several very short patches were suggested to resolve this issue, including
a one-liner that allows our patched GCC to specifically rewrite `__FILE__` in
Qt test code to a real path which takes advantage of the ability to specify
multiple mappings using [BUILD_PATH_PREFIX_MAP](https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/build-path-prefix-map/).

Separately, [work is under way to address the other unrelated
concerns](https://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/reproducible-builds/Week-of-Mon-20170814/009124.html)
raised about the patch by [GCC upstream back in August](https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2017-08/msg00232.html).
