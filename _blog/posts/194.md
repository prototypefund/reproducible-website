* [FIXME](https://bugs.debian.org/918480)

* Holger uploaded koji 1.16.0-3 to fix #918280.

* Last week has seen lots of progress on the [initial implementation of -fmacro-prefix-map and -ffile-prefix-map](https://reviews.llvm.org/D49466) which might or not might make it into the Clang 8.0 branch which will be created next week.
