Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday January 6 and Saturday January 12 2019:

* Reproducibility patches for [GNU mtools](https://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/) finally entered the Debian *unstable* distribution via [Chris Lamb](https://chris-lamb.co.uk/)'s upload of the [mtools 4.0.23-1](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1020103/accepted-mtools-4023-1-source-amd64-into-unstable/) package via the ["salvaging"](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/ch05.en.html#package-salvaging). In light of this, Chris [rebased his merge request](https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/debian-installer/merge_requests/3#note_59187) to make the [Debian Installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/) images reproducible, responded to some subsequent code review and re-opened the discussion on the [corresponding bug report](https://bugs.debian.org/900918#29).

* This week has seen lots of progress on [an initial implementation of `-fmacro-prefix-map` and `-ffile-prefix-map`](https://reviews.llvm.org/D49466) in the [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) compiler toolkit. This may make it into [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)'s 8.0 branch, to be created next week.

* Chris Lamb opened Debian bug [#918480](https://bugs.debian.org/918480), requesting that the [`squashfs-tools`](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/squashfs-tools) package (which creates and maniupulates read-only compressed file systems) moves to the [`squashfskit`](https://github.com/squashfskit/squashfskit) fork maintained by Alexander "*lynxis*" Couzens. However, it transpired that most of the changes required for the generation of reproducible `squashfs` filesystem images have been merged upstream modulo two patches that Chris rebased & backported and [were subsequently uploaded](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1018142/accepted-squashfs-tools-143-8-source-into-unstable/) in `squashfs-tools 1:4.3-8` by the Debian maintainer, Laszlo Boszormenyi.

* Arnout Engelen's thread on our [mailing list](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/) regarding [how to share rebuilder "attestations"](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2019-January/001378.html) in the Java ecosystem is ongoing.

* On Wednesday 9th [Chris Lamb gave a talk](http://actux.eu.org/2019/01/conference-sur-les-builds-reproductibles-mercredi-9-janvier-2019/) at [Universit√© de Rennes](https://www.univ-rennes1.fr/), France on reproducible builds. Thank you to Mathieu Goessens for organising this event.

* Holger Levsen [uploaded koji 1.16.0-3](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1019131/accepted-koji-1160-3-source-into-unstable/) to Debian *unstable* to add missing dependencies on `python-requests` and `python-dateutil`, fixing Debian bug [#918780](https://bugs.debian.org/918780).

* Igor Dvorzhak's [merge request](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/strip-nondeterminism/merge_requests/3) against `strip-nondeterminism` (our tool that post-processes files to remove known non-deterministic output) in order to parallelise the execution of the `dh_strip_nondeterminism(1)` utility and `.zip` handler was reviewed and merged by Chris Lamb.

* Chris Lamb updated [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/) (our in-depth "diff-on-steroids" utility which helps us diagnose reproducibility issues in packages) to add a note to the "Files similar despite different names" comment to clarify that a lower score is more similar [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/3a9cf0d)] and to prefer to emit a comment that files are "identical" rather than having a "fuzziness score of zero" [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/9f30b4b)].

* 6 Debian package reviews were added, 9 were updated and 4 were removed in this week, adding to [our knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html). Chris Lamb also added a new [`buildpath_in_binaries_generated_by_ada_compiler`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/571a164d) toolchain issue and finally added note regarding [scdoc](https://drewdevault.com/2018/05/13/scdoc.html) [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/1fd28f08)].
