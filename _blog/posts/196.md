* [The compiler for the elixir language](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir) got a number of updates to [make it compile in 2019](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/issues/8702) and [2020](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/8688) and to [create all its .beam files in a reproducible way](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/issues/8689). This allowed to build reproducible openSUSE packages. They also are [adding some reproducibility tests to their CI](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/8701) so that it does not break as easily in the future.
