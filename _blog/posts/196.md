Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday January 20 and Saturday January 26 2019:

* There was considerable progress in making the [Debian Installer](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/) images reproducible with a [number of rounds of code review](https://alioth-lists.debian.net/pipermail/reproducible-builds/Week-of-Mon-20190114/011054.html), a subsequent merge of [Chris Lamb](https://chris-lamb.co.uk/)'s [merge request](https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/debian-installer/merge_requests/3) and closing of the [corresponding bug report](https://bugs.debian.org/900918#29) for the time being, pending further testing.

* At [linux.conf.au](https://linux.conf.au/) 2019 in Christchurch, New Zealand there were (at least!) two talks that touched on Reproducible Builds. First, [Benno Rice](https://twitter.com/jeamland) gave a talk titled "[How Much Do You Trust That Package? Understanding The Software Supply Chain](https://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/237/)" ([YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnELtqE6mMM)). In addition, [Aleksandra Pawlik](https://github.com/apawlik) presented on "[Building reproducible computing environments: a workshop for non-experts](https://2019.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/185/)" ([YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2xzQFQ2hg0)).

* [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/) is our in-depth "diff-on-steroids" utility which helps us diagnose reproducibility issues in packages. There were a few updates this week from Chris Lamb, including not crashing if we were unable to successfully extract a [guestfs](http://libguestfs.org/) filesystem [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/dda7713)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/6b8e47d)] ([#901982](https://bugs.debian.org/901982)), avoid clumsy profiling title length calculations by using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/ef2aa62)] and drop the printing out [`dpkg-query(1)`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/dpkg-query) output when running tests. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/d98c4b0)]

* The [compiler for the Elixir language](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir) received a number of updates [to make it compile in 2019](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/issues/8702) and [in 2020](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/8688) and to [create all its `.beam` files in a reproducible manner](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/issues/8689) which permitted the creation of reproducible [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) packages. They also are [adding reproducibility tests](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/8701) to their continuous-integration system so that it does not regress in the future.

* Chris Lamb's [historical summary and a request for action](https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/fontconfig/2019-January/006420.html) posted on [Fontconfig](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fontconfig/)'s [mailing list](https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/fontconfig/) in order that a solution may be found and included in Debian *buster*, has resulted in a [considerable process and discussion](https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/fontconfig/2019-January/006464.html) on the upstream mailing list.

* Hervé Boutemy made more updates to the [reproducible-builds.org](https://reproducible-builds.org) project website this week, including adding section on auditing a JVM build. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/c7191b9)], defining `build.setup` as an optional field [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/6c01120)], explaining the distinction between build instructions vs effective environment [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/ba2f561)] and detailed the [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) rebuild instructions [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/e587f04)].:w

* Marvin Humphrey started a thread on [our mailing list](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/) this week on the [Definition of "reproducible build"](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2019-January/001426.html), referencing a thread thread on the [Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org)'s [legal-discuss mailing list](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2019-January/001428.html).

* Bernhard M. Wiedemann posted his monthly [Reproducible Builds status update](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2019-01/msg00393.html) for the [openSUSE](https://opensuse.org/) distribution.

* Reproducible builds were mentioned in [Episode 9](https://librelounge.org/episodes/episode-9-funding-free-software-development-pt2.html) of the [Libre Lounge](https://librelounge.org/) podcast in a more-general discussion about funding free software development. ([Direct link](https://pca.st/1MUC#t=23m00s))

* The [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix) "purely functional package manager" was uploaded to Debian as version `2.2.1-2`, pending [processing in the NEW queue](https://ftp-master.debian.org/new/nix_2.2.1-2.html).

* Lukas Pühringer [posted a report](https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu/blog/2019-01-18-in-toto-paris) from the [in-toto](https://in-toto.github.io/) project's participation in the recent [Reproducible Builds summit in Paris](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/paris2018/).

* 10 Debian package reviews were added, 9 were updated and 20 were removed in this week, adding to [our knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html). Two new issue types were added: [`randomness_in_ids_generated_by_org-html-publish-to-html`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/0baeb163) and [`ftbfs_due_to_f_file_prefix_map`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/a868eb81) by Chris Lamb and Mattia Rizzolo respectfully.
