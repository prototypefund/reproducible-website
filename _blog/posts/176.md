Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday September 2 and Saturday September 8 2018:

* The *trydiffoscope* command-line client for [try.diffoscope.org](https://try.diffoscope.org) was [uploaded to Debian unstable](https://tracker.debian.org/news/985852/accepted-trydiffoscope-6701-source-all-into-unstable/) by Chris Lamb. It [included contributions already covered in previous weeks](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/trydiffoscope/commits/debian/67.0.1) as well as adding a [add missing `Build-Depends` on `dh-python`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/trydiffoscope/commit/fa02645).

* There were further updates for [our website](https://reproducible-builds.org/) including Arnout Engelen [fixing some presentation titles and URLs](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/82faf41) and making some initial changes to [use the logo and colours from our style guide](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/8bf46ad) which were subsequently adjusted by Chris Lamb to avoid [breaking the navigation](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/57f586a) and [ensuring images were visible on all pages](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/4b4da9d) on the site.

* Our [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)-based testing framework that powers [tests.reproducible-builds.org](tests.reproducible-builds.org) was updated this month, including Holger Levsen [explaining how to cleanup `systemctl`'s state](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/3fb7f9bd) and to [drop a "work-in-progress" disclaimer](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/d1652e71) and Hans-Christoph Steiner [added new packages to the FDroid dependency list](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/ee95c182).

* 11 Debian package reviews were added, 9 were updated and 11 were removed in this week, adding to [our knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html). A new [`randomness\_in\_frozenset\_representations\_in\_sphinx`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/119c65aa) toolchain issue was identified and added by Chris Lamb.
