What happened in the [reproducible
builds](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds) effort between March 20th and March 26th:

Toolchain fixes
---------------

 * Sebastian Ramacher uploaded [breathe](https://tracker.debian.org/breathe)/4.2.0-1 which makes its output deterministic. [Original patch](https://bugs.debian.org/809186) by Chris Lamb, [merged upstream](https://github.com/michaeljones/breathe/pull/235).
 * Rafael Laboissiere uploaded [octave](https://tracker.debian.org/octave)/4.0.1-1 which allows packages to be built in place and avoid unreproducible builds due to temporary build directories appearing in the `.oct` files.

Daniel Kahn Gillmor worked on removing build path from build symbols submitting a [patch](https://bugs.debian.org/819185) adding `-fdebug-prefix-map` to [clang](https://tracker.debian.org/clang) to match GCC, [another patch](https://bugs.debian.org/819176) against [gcc-5](https://tracker.debian.org/gcc-5) to backport the removal of `-fdebug-prefix-map` from `DW_AT_producer`, and finally by [proposing](https://bugs.debian.org/819194) the addition of a `normalizedebugpath` to the `reproducible` feature set of `dpkg-buildflags` that would use `-fdebug-prefix-map` to replace the current directory with “`.`” using `-fdebug-prefix-map`.

Sergey Poznyakoff merged the `--clamp-mtime` option so that it will be [featured in the next Tar release](https://bugs.debian.org/816072#14). This option is likely to be used by `dpkg-deb` to [implement deterministic mtimes for packaged files](https://bugs.debian.org/759886).

`i386` build nodes have been setup by converting 2 of the 4 `amd64` nodes to `i386`. (h01ger)

Misc.
-----

On March 20th, Chris Lamb gave a talk at [FOSSASIA 2016](https://2016.fossasia.org/schedule/) in Singapore.

The very same day, but a few timezones apart, h01ger did a presentation at [LibrePlanet 2016](https://www.libreplanet.org/2016/program/) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Seven [GSoC/Outreachy applications](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2016) were made by potential interns to work on various aspects of the reproducible builds effort. On top of interacting with several applicants, prospective mentors gathered to review the applications.
