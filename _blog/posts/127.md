    - Output hashes after a successful `--auto-build`.
    - Print a warning message if we reproduced successfully but didn't vary
      everything.
    - Update examples in documentation.
  - Have `dpkg-source` extract to different build dir iff varying the
    build-path.
  - Pass `--debug` to diffoscope if verbosity >= 2.
  - Pass `--exclude-directory-metadata` to diffoscope(1) by default.
  - Much refactoring to support the other work and several minor bug fixes.
- Holger Levsen:
  - Bump standards version to 4.1.1, no changes needed.
