Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday February 10th and Saturday February 16th 2019:

* `strip-nondeterminism` is our tool that post-processes files to remove known non-deterministic output. This week, Chris Lamb adjusted its behaviour to deduplicate hardlinks via `stat(2)` before processing to avoid issues when handling files in parallel; as the per-filetype handlers are yet currently guaranteed to be atomic, one process could temporarily truncate a file which can cause errors in other processes operating on the "same" file under a different pathname. This was thus causing package build failures in packages that de-duplicate hardlinks in their build process such as the [Debian Administrator's Handbook](https://debian-handbook.info/) ([#922168](https://bugs.debian.org/#922168)).

* There was [a brief update from the Debian Ruby maintainers](https://bugs.debian.org/848660) on whether the language might need to strip `-fdebug-prefix-map` from the tools used to build extensions.

* On [our mailing list](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/listinfo/rb-general), Holger Levsen [re-raised a question](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2019-February/001446.html) regarding uploading the "official" `.buildinfo` files to [buildinfo.debian.net](https://buildinfo.debian.net/).

* On Tuesday 26th February Chris Lamb will speak at [Speck&Tech 31 "Open Security"](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/specktech-31-open-security-tickets-53503912643) on Reproducible Builds in Trento, Italy.

* Jelle van der Waa fixed some spelling mistakes on the [reproducible-builds.org](https://reproducible-builds.org) project website. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/dea014e)]

* 6 Debian package reviews were added, 4 were updated and 16 were removed in this week, adding to [our knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html).

## diffoscope development

![]({{ "/images/blog/199/diffoscope.svg" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

[diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/) is our in-depth "diff-on-steroids" utility which helps us diagnose reproducibility issues in packages. This week:

* Chris Lamb:
    * Add support for comparing `.crx` [Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) extensions. ([#41](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/issues/41))
    * Add support for comparing MP3 and files with similar metadata. ([#43](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/issues/43))
    * Replace the literal `xxd(1)` output (!)(!)  in `tests/data/hello.wasm` with its binary equivalent ([#47](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/issues/47)) and ensure both [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) test data files are actually unique. ([#42](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/issues/42))
    * Catch tracebacks when mounting invalid filesystem images under [guestfs](http://libguestfs.org/). [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/03b9ffb)]
    * Fix tests when using [Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/) 9.20 vs 9.26 for Debian stable and for stable with the security repositories enabled. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/4a35e55)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/a7ad758)]
    * Temporarily drop `ubuntu-devel` from internal test matrix due to a `linux-firmware` package installation issue. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/fc3762e)]

* Ed Maste:
    * Include relocations in [objdump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objdump) disassembly. ([#48](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/issues/48))

* Graham Christensen:
    * Clarify "no file-specific differences" message when we fallback to a binary diff. ([!19](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/merge_requests/19))

* Mattia Rizzolo:
    * Make `test_ps.test_text_diff` pass with Ghostscript version 9.26. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/de05b14)]

In addition, Vagrant Cascadian updated diffoscope in [GNU Guix](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/) [[...](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/commit/?id=295de8cc1af9afc2683cee332793bff1730bf1b3)] and went on to upload disorderfs [[...](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/commit/?id=75d12c40f7edd7f3abaada916d1c2018bd3b0d46)] and trydiffoscope [[...](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/commit/?id=706460a35754a47bf832a40de4f22271e7088226)] too.
