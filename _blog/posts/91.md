Toolchain development and fixes
-------------------------------

Ximin Luo [continued work](https://github.com/infinity0/rb-prefix-map) on data
formats, code, and test cases for `SOURCE_PREFIX_MAP`. He also continued to
[talk with the rustc team](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/38322) on
the topic.

Chris Lamb [submitted a patch](https://github.com/smcameron/wordwarvi/pull/5)
to implement `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` for wordwarvi, a game which gave extra points
to people who built it from source within one hour. This fixes Debian [#786593](https://bugs.debian.org/786593).

[Launchpad bug 1657704](https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/1657704) was
filed for them to start accepting buildinfo files.

diffoscope development
----------------------

diffoscope 69 was uploaded to unstable by Chris Lamb. It included
[contributions](https://anonscm.debian.org/git/reproducible/diffoscope.git/log/?h=69)
from:

- Maria Glukhova:
  - Bug fixes: [#850055](https://bugs.debian.org/850055), [#850501](https://bugs.debian.org/850501).
  - Improve comparison of APK files: [#850502](https://bugs.debian.org/850502).
  - Add comparison of image metadata: [#849395](https://bugs.debian.org/849395).
- Chris Lamb:
  - Many bug fixes: [#849411](https://bugs.debian.org/849411), [#850485](https://bugs.debian.org/850485), [#850807](https://bugs.debian.org/850807),
    [#850850](https://bugs.debian.org/850850), [#851588](https://bugs.debian.org/851588).
  - Add comparison of ICO files: [#850730](https://bugs.debian.org/850730).
  - Optimisations: disable profiling unless needed, and pre-compile regexes.
  - Many code quality improvements.
- Mattia Rizzolo:
  - Deduplicate code for recognising file types based on `RE_FILE_TYPE` and
    `RE_FILE_EXTENSION`.
  - Improve code quality in tests.

Further development continued in Git, and will be released as version 70 next
week:

- Chris Lamb:
  - Add tests for `--html-dir` output and improve code quality elsewhere in tests.
  - Add markdown and reStructuredText output, as well as tests for these.
  - Improve software architecture of presenters.
  - Fix error-checking in the Haskell comparator.
- James Clarke:
  - Haskell comparator: properly extract version from interface files.
- Mattia Rizzolo:
  - Improve some documentation.
- Brett Smith:
  - Improve documentation including `--help` output.


reproducible-builds.org website development
-------------------------------------------

- Brett Smith:
  - berlin2016: List Conservancy consistently as a participant.
- Chris Lamb:
  - Add Valerie's talk to resources page.
- Daniel Shahaf:
  - Improved the "How to chair a meeting" section.


tests.reproducible-builds.org
-----------------------

- Holger added `arm64` to https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_variations.html

- Mattia improved our process for building
  [the performance
  page](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_performance.html) so
  that stats for new architectures are computed correctly without manual
  intervention.

- Holger enhanced the build node maintenance scripts to correctly detect if
  `/dev/shm` is mounted incorrectly (due to [#851427](https://bugs.debian.org/851427)) and deployed an
  `/etc/rc.local` startup script to all systems which works around it. As a
  result, [jenkins_semaphore_setup_issue](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/issues/unstable/jenkins_semaphore_setup_issue_issue.html) should be obsolete.

- Mattia improved the diskspace monitoring visible at
  [our munin page](https://jenkins.debian.net/munin) for the 44 nodes we're
  currently running.

- Holger added 6GB more RAM to `jenkins.debian.net`, for a total of 64GB RAM,
  to better cope with the new jobs due to `arm64. As usual, thanks to
  [profitbricks.com](http://profitbricks.com) for the hardware resources
  enabling this work.


Misc.
-----

This week's edition was written by Ximin Luo, Vagrant Cascadian, Holger Levsen
& Chris Lamb and reviewed by a bunch of Reproducible Builds folks on IRC & the
mailing lists.
