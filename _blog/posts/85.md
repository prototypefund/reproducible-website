Reviews of unreproducible packages
----------------------------------

47 package reviews have been added, 84 have been updated and 3 have been
removed in this week, adding to our knowledge about [identified
issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html).

1 new issue type has been added: [lessc_captures_build_path](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/issues/unstable/lessc_captures_build_path_issue.html)


Weekly QA work
--------------

During our reproducibility testing, some FTBFS bugs have been detected and
reported by:

 - Chris Lamb (8)


diffoscope development
----------------------

Chris Lamb fixed a division-by-zero in the progress bar, split out
trydiffoscope into a separate package, and made some performance enhancements.
Maria Glukhova fixed build issues with Python 3.4


strip-nondeterminism development
--------------------------------

Anders Kaseorg added support for .par files, by allowing them to be
treated as Zip archives; and Chris Lamb improved some documentation.


reprotest development
---------------------

Ximin Luo added the ability to vary the build time using
[faketime](https://packages.debian.org/sid/faketime), as well as other code
quality improvements and cleanups.

He also discovered a little-known fact about faketime - that it also modifies
filesystem timestamps by default. He submitted a [PR](https://github.com/wolfcw/libfaketime/pull/102)
to libfaketime upstream to improve the documentation on this, which was quickly
accepted, and also disabled this feature in reprotest's own usage of faketime.


buildinfo.debian.net development
--------------------------------

There was further work on buildinfo.debian.net code. Chris Lamb added support
for buildinfo format 0.2 and made rejection notices clearer; and Emanuel
Bronshtein fixed some links to use HTTPS.


Misc.
-----

This week's edition was written by Ximin Luo and reviewed by a bunch
of Reproducible Builds folks on IRC and via email.
