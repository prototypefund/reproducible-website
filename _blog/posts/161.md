* [FIXME](http://layer-acht.org/thinking/blog/20180520-Debian-is-wrong/)

* [FIXME](Wed 23 11:49  * h01ger has rebooted the arm64 nodes and (not for the first time) wonders if this should be included in the weekly blog to document the maintence costs we have)
* h01ger also removed the old kernels on the arm64 nodes to prevent /boot from filling up.
