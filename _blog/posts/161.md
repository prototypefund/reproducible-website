* [FIXME](http://layer-acht.org/thinking/blog/20180520-Debian-is-wrong/)

* [FIXME](Wed 23 11:49  * h01ger has rebooted the arm64 nodes and (not for the first time) wonders if this should be included in the weekly blog to document the maintence costs we have)
* h01ger also removed the old kernels on the arm64 nodes to prevent /boot from filling up.

* [FIXME](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-May/000981.html)

* [New SSL certificate for buildinfo.debian.net (lamby)](https://buildinfo.debian.net/)

* [mentions reproducible, hopefully public by the time of post publication](https://lwn.net/Articles/754443/)

* [FIXME]: distribution qute of the week, already public: https://lwn.net/Articles/755093/

* [Mes 0.14 released](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-May/000983.html): Mes+MesCC now compiles a self-hosting TinyCC that has only been slightly patched. This means that we can now build a tcc that depends only on a 1MB ASCII M1 seed.  GuixSD currently uses a ~250MB binary seed to build gcc. Next targets are: build gcc using this almost full-source bootstrapped
tcc, and reduce the 1MB ASCII M1 seed to ~100KB of M2 source, which is
a restricted subset of C.
