Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday 6th and Saturday 12th August 2017:

* There were two talks mainly about Reproducible Builds at [DebConf17](https://debconf17.debconf.org):
  * [Reproducible builds: Status update](https://debconf17.debconf.org/talks/14/) by Chris Lamb, Holger Levsen, Maria Glukhova, Steven Chamberlain, Vagrant Cascadian, Valerie Young and Ximin Luo.
  * [Fun with .buildinfo](https://debconf17.debconf.org/talks/91/) by Steven Chamberlain.

* Reproducible builds were also mentioned in many other talks including:
  * [Using Qubes OS from the POV of a Debian developer ](https://debconf17.debconf.org/talks/16/) by Holger Levsen.
  * [Debian for Medical Software](https://debconf17.debconf.org/talks/165/) by AndrÃ© Roth.
  * [Let's maintain jenkins.debian.org as a team ](https://debconf17.debconf.org/talks/120/) by Holger Levsen.
