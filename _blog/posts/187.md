Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday November 18 and Saturday November 24 2018:

* Reproducible Builds were [mentioned on the latest episode](https://latenightlinux.com/late-night-linux-episode-50/) of the [Late Night Linux](https://bitbucket.org/mstrobel/procyon) podcast starting at `18m03s`. ([Direct link](https://pca.st/He12#t=18m03s).)

* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) are continuing their work on reproducible builds, documenting their progress on their [corresponding Confluence page](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=74682318).

* Holger Levsen posted to [our mailing list](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/) that *Reproducible Builds* t-shirts are available to contributors. Please see the [corresponding thread](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-November/001266.html) for more information.

* Chris Lamb [requested that the "Deterministic compilation" Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequested_moves%2FTechnical_requests&type=revision&diff=870242885&oldid=870242654) be renamed to [Reproducible builds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducible_builds) (via the "[Technical move requests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requested_moves/Technical_requests)" mechanism) given that this is now overwhelmingly the generally accepted term for this concept.

* Bernhard M. Wiedemann posted [the monthly openSUSE reproducible builds status](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2018-11/msg00250.html) with details on the remaining 58 major issues in 2565 openSUSE DVD packages - gcc, python and openjdk are the most annoying ones.

* 17 Debian package reviews were added, 5 were updated and 14 were removed in this week, adding to [our knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html). Two new issue types were added this week by Chris Lamb ([`timestamp_added_by_gnuradio_grcc`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/adf7ef93) and [`paths_vary_due_to_usrmerge`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/9ee46a4d)) and he also updated a number of others, including as well as adding references to various existing notes ([1](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/e2b6bea3) & [2](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/0ea3da74)), merging a duplicate issue [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/c95d34e7)], and adding a bug reference for a patch [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/6e9c5774)].

* Holger Levsen updated our website project to add [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) as a participant at [our upcoming Paris Summit](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/paris2018/) [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/c6166c7)] and replaced an instance of "Tor" with "[Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/)" [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/67c74fb)]. In addition, Chris Lamb added a number of missing dates to the presentation page [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/04d82dd)].

* We have received more than 50 registrations for the upcoming [Reproducible Builds summit in Paris](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/paris2018/) between 11thâ€”13th December 2018 and registrations are now closed. Again, very much looking forward to seeing you there.

* Vagrant Cascadian automated uploading `.buildinfo` files from the Debian archive to the experimental [buildinfo.debian.net](https://buildinfo.debian.net/) service. Over 1000 `.buildinfo` files are typically uploaded each day.

diffoscope development
----------------------

[diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/) is our in-depth "diff-on-steroids" utility which helps us diagnose reproducibility issues in packages. This week, version `106` was [uploaded to Debian unstable](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1005294/accepted-diffoscope-106-source-into-unstable/) by Mattia Rizzolo. It [included contributions already covered in previous weeks](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commits/106) as well as new ones by Mattia Rizzolo:

* Override the new [Lintian](https://lintian.debian.org/)'s [public-upstream-key-in-native-package](https://lintian.debian.org/tags/public-upstream-key-in-native-package.html) tag. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/2059195)]
* Temporary disable `Depends:` on [Gnumeric](http://www.gnumeric.org/) and [Procyon](https://bitbucket.org/mstrobel/procyon) as they are RC buggy. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/de13715)]

    * Add support for calculating a [PureOS](https://www.pureos.net/) package set. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/9507efe7)]

* Holger Levsen:
    * Explicitly also install [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/). [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/d623d03c)]
