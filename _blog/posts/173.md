Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday August 12 and Saturday August 18 2018:

* [Christoph Berg](https://www.df7cb.de/) merged [support for reproducible builds](https://github.com/postgis/postgis/commit/873c6cba3e7f7e87b615b25c50d9c8dcede661ec) in the [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) spatial database extensions for the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.

* Arnout Engelen et al., continued an interesting discussion on [our mailing list](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/listinfo/rb-general) which [compares the approaches Debian and Arch with respect to `.buildinfo` files](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-August/001105.html). intrigeri added a description of [the closest thing Tails has to a `.buildinfo` file](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-August/001122.html).

* Alexis Murzeau updated [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org) (our in-depth "diff-on-steroids" utility which helps us diagnose reproducibility issues in packages) to [fix matching for `.deb` archive members](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/8b90ec1), closing Debian bug [#903565](https://bugs.debian.org/903565). In addition, Joannis Valasakis [filed an ITP](https://bugs.debian.org/906030) ([Intent To Package](https://wiki.debian.org/ITP)) bug in Debian for [fsdiff](https://github.com/kanocomputing/fsdiff), a tool to compare two filesystems which may be useful to incorporate.

* A [patch to was merged](https://reviews.llvm.org/D50559) to the [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) compiler [addressing an ordering issue in Objective-C binaries](https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35277). It now sorts a hash that varied from [Address space layout randomization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization) (ASLR).

* A long-open bug in the [Gconf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GConf) configuration management system for [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) was [finally marked as WONTFIX](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=784738#c3).

* Two package reviews were added, three were updated and 11 were removed in this week, adding to [our knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html) in Debian. A new [jekyll\_site\_time\_timestamp](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/402eafa1) toolchain issue was identified by Chris Lamb.
