Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday August 19 and Saturday August 25 2018:

* Daniel Kahn Gillmor provided two patches to [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org) (our in-depth "diff-on-steroids" utility which helps us diagnose reproducibility issues in packages) to first [correct the spelling of "ereser"](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/3522476) and then to [avoid a line eraser error on dumb terminals](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/038ac84) ([#906967](htps://bugs.debian.org/906967)).

* There were a number of updates to our [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)-based testing framework that powers [tests.reproducible-builds.org](tests.reproducible-builds.org), including Holger Levsen adjusting our scripts [to try harder when bringing back nodes](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/7cb81648) as well as [bringing the "ff2a" host back online](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/0f3ec3fd). In addition, Vagrant Cascadian [added new SSH keys](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/a0cd9094) for himself.

* Arnout Engelen provided some updates for [our website](https://reproducible-builds.org/) to [fix build warning](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/6490dde) and then to [describe how a `.buildinfo` is recorded](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/06416b6). Chris Lamb also [added a very simple integration testsuite](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/22c1dcb) based on [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/).

* In last week's post we reported that [Christoph Berg](https://www.df7cb.de/) had merged [support for reproducible builds](https://github.com/postgis/postgis/commit/873c6cba3e7f7e87b615b25c50d9c8dcede661ec) in the [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) spatial database extensions for the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database. This week, he [updated the Debian PostgreSQL build wrapper](https://salsa.debian.org/postgresql/postgresql-common/commit/c32ca637e093b4a1a3207ccbd86d82e56d9c5937) to ensure that `CFLAGS` are correctly passed to the underlying build system removing an obstacle to the packages being reproducible.

* [Simon McVittie](https://smcv.pseudorandom.co.uk/) updated [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) in Debian, [applying a patch from Chris Lamb to make `immodules.cache` files reproducible](https://salsa.debian.org/gnome-team/gtk2/commit/7deeede44c844e99402816ebc035de4d575f3db0#9c96da0e9f91d7d8937b69b524702c106258f0d1_12_16), fixing a long-open Debian bug [#872729](https://bugs.debian.org/872729).

* On Tuesday August 21st, there was a brief [online IRC meeting](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-August/001116.html).

* 17 Debian package reviews were added, 10 were updated and 14 were removed in this week, adding to [our knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html).
