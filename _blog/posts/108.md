tests.reproducible-builds.org
-----------------------

Holger wrote a new systemd-based scheduling system replacing 162 constantly running Jenkins jobs which were slowing down job execution in general:

- Nothing fancy really, just 370 lines of shell code in two scripts, out of these 370 lines 80 are comments and 162 are node definitions for those 162 "jobs".
- Worker logs not yet as good as with Jenkins but usually we don't need real time log viewing of specific builds. Or rather, its a waste of time to do it. (Actual package build logs remain unchanged.)
- Builds are a lot faster for the fast archs, but not so much difference on `armhf`.
- Since April 12 for `i386` (and a week later for the rest), the images below are ordered with `i386` on top, then `amd64`, `armhf` and `arm64`. Except for `armhf` it's pretty visible when the switch was made.
