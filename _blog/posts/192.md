Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday December 23 and Saturday December 29 2018:

* A full and in-depth report about [our recent summit](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/paris2018/) is under preparation but in the meantime the [Guix](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/) project [published their own report on the event](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/blog/2018/reproducible-builds-summit-4th-edition/).

* Rolf Neugebauer proposed an update to [LinuxKit](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit) (a toolkit for building custom minimal, immutable Linux distributions) to [add initial support for reproducible builds](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/pull/3255).

* Bernhard posted the [monthly openSUSE reproducible builds update](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2018-12/msg00171.html) to the [`opensuse-factory`](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory) mailing list.

* Holger discussed reproducible builds for the [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org) (a catalogue of free-software applications for the Android platform) with the upstream developers at the [35C3](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2018/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) conference in Leipzig, Germany and participated at the [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) meetup there as well.

* 9 Debian package reviews were added, 3 were updated and 9 were removed in this week, adding to [our knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html). Two issue types were added by [Chris Lamb](https://chris-lamb.co.uk/): [`timestamps_embedded_in_manpages_by_scdoc`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/be430acb) & [`randomness_in_intercal_files`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/d07414e4).

* The [Open Build Service (OBS)](https://openbuildservice.org/), a system to build and distribute binary packages from sources in an automatic & consistent form. was found to [publish new binaries under old names](https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/issues/6690) which was confusing some tools.

* On January 9th 2019, Chris Lamb will speak at [Université de Rennes](https://www.univ-rennes1.fr/), France on reproducible builds.

* Holger Levsen bumped the `Standards-Version` field in [all of our tools]({{ "/tools/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) to `4.3.0`. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/2d236c7)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/strip-nondeterminism/commit/57de24c)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/disorderfs/commit/a12fdeb)][[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reprotest/commit/62cbe96)]

## Packages reviewed and fixed, and bugs filed

* [Bernhard M. Wiedemann](https://lizards.opensuse.org/author/bmwiedemann/):
    * [python-sh](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1120329) (FTBFS-j1)
    * [perl](https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2018/12/msg253240.html) ([ASLR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization))
    * [gengetopt](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?55311) (support [`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`]({{ "/docs/source-date-epoch/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) in `mdate-sh`)
    * [xen](https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/661659) (fix a bug triggered by reproducible fix)
    * [opa-ff](https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/661771) (drop CPU-detection via `-march=native` [also filed upstream](https://github.com/intel/opa-ff/issues/20))

In addition, Mattia Rizzolo filed a build failure bug.
