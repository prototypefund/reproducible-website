* [FIXME](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/blog/2018/reproducible-builds-summit-4th-edition/)

* Holger discussed reproducible builds for F-Droid with some F-Droid developers at 35C3 and participated at the Arch Linux Meetup as well.

* Bernhard posted the [monthly openSUSE r-b update](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2018-12/msg00171.html)

* [OBS](https://openbuildservice.org/) was found to [publish new binaries published under old names](https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/issues/6690) which confuses some tools
