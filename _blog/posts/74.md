Here is what happened in the [Reproducible
Builds](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds) effort between Sunday September 18 and Saturday September 24 2016:

Outreachy
---------

We intend to participate in [Outreachy Round 13](https://wiki.debian.org/Outreachy/Round13/Projects/ReproducibleBuildsOfDebian) and look forward for new enthusiastic applications to contribute to reproducible builds. We're offering four different areas to work on:

- Improve test and debugging tools.
- Improving reproducibility of Debian packages.
- Improving Debian infrastructure.
- Help collaboration across distributions.

Reproducible Builds World summit #2 
-----------------------------------

We are planning e a similar event to our [Athens 2015 summit](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/athens2015/) and expect to reveal more information soon. If you haven't been contacted yet but would like to attend, please contact [holger](mailto:holger@layer-acht.org).

Toolchain development and fixes
-------------------------------

Mattia uploaded [dpkg](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/dpkg)/1.18.10.0~reproducible1 to our [experimental repository](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/ExperimentalToolchain).
and [covered the details for the upload](https://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/reproducible-builds/Week-of-Mon-20160919/007119.html) in a mailing list post.

The most important change is the incorporation of improvements made by Guillem
Jover (dpkg maintainer) to the .buildinfo generator. This is also in the hope
that it will speed up the merge in the upstream.

One of the other relevant changes from before is that .buildinfo files
generated from binary-only builds will no longer include the hash of the .dsc
file in Checksums-Sha256 as documented in the
[specification](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/BuildinfoSpecification#buildinfo_field_descriptions).

Even if it was considered important to include a checksum of the source package
in .buildinfo, storing it that way breaks other assumptions (eg. that
Checksums-Sha256 contains only files part of that are part of a single upload,
whereas the .dsc might not be part of that upload), thus we look forward for
another solution to store the source checksum in .buildinfo.

tests.reproducible-builds.org
-----------------------------

- The full rebuild of all packages in unstable (for all tested archs) with the new build path variation has been completed. This has had the result that we are down to ~75% reproducible packages in unstable now. In comparison, for testing (where we don't vary the build path) we are still at ~90%. IRC notifications for unstable have been enabled again. (Holger)
- Make the notes job robust about bad data (see [#833695](https://bugs.debian.org/833695) and [#833738](https://bugs.debian.org/833738)). (Holger)
- Setup profitbricks-build7 running stretch as testing reproducible builds of F-Droid need to use a newer version of vagrant in order to support running vagrant VMs with kvm on kvm. (Holger)
- The misbehaving 'opi2a' armhf node has been replaced with a Jetson-TK1 board kindly donated by NVidia. This machine is using an NVIDIA tegra-k1 (cortex-a15) quad-core board. (vagrant and Holger)

Misc.

This week's edition was written by Chris Lamb, Holger Levsen and Mattia Rizzolo and reviewed by a bunch of Reproducible Builds folks on IRC.
