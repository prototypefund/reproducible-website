Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday March 17 and Saturday March 23 2019:

* On [our mailing list](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/) this week, Mike Miller started a discussion around [development toolchains embedding compiler options in binares](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2019-March/001503.html). This can result in unreproducible builds, ironically caused by [GCC flags](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Overall-Options.html) that were intended to remove non-deterministic behaviour in the first place (eg. `-fdebug-prefix-map` and `-ffile-prefix-map`).

* [Arnout Engelen](https://arnout.engelen.eu/) proposed [a pull request](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/26546) for the [akka](https://akka.io/) Java-based messaging/build framework to include a reproducible builds plugin which was subsequently merged.

* [Izaak "Zaak" Beekman](https://izaakbeekman.com/) announced that the 2.6.1 [OpenCorrays](http://www.opencoarrays.org/) parallelism library for Fortran 2018 compilers now [supports reproducible builds](https://github.com/sourceryinstitute/opencoarrays/releases/tag/2.6.1).

* David Pr√©vot updated the [reproducible-builds.org project website](https://reproducible-builds.org) to specify that the PHP example for `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` uses an integer type as expected in strict mode.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/9db5438)]

* 17 Debian package reviews were added, 2 were updated and 9 were removed in this week, adding to [our knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html). Chris Lamb identified and categorised four new issues,[`build_path_in_typelib_files_generated_by_gir_compiler`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/a1697857), [`build_path_in_qdoc`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/3d6b96da), [`bundle_name_in_java_manifest_mf`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/0a6bebbb) and [`randomness_in_prolog_saved_stage`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/23bc637f).

## diffoscope development

[![]({{ "/images/blog/202/diffoscope.svg" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://diffoscope.org)

[diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/) is our in-depth "diff-on-steroids" utility which helps us diagnose reproducibility issues in packages. This week:

* Chris Lamb:
    * Always warn if the `tlsh` module is not available (not just if a specific fuzziness threshold is specified) to match the epilog of the `--help` output. This prevents missing support for file rename detection.&nbsp;([#29](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/issues/29))
    * Fix a number of tests when using GhostScript `9.20` vs `9.26` for Debian `stable` vs. the same distribution with the security/point release applied.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/8c7b085)]

* Mattia Rizzolo:
    * Ignore the version mismatch detection when building backport.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/f23e04d)]
    * Make test\_ps.test\_text\_diff pass with ghostscript 9.26.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/a5426f7)]

* Milena Boselli Rosa:
    * Remove the `type` HTML attribute from `style` elements.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/fc082d2)]
    * Prevent empty values for the `name` attribute name on HTML anchor tags and add an `id` to its parent `div` container.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/41968b8)]
    * Fix a *Text run is not in Unicode Normalization Form C* HTML validation warning.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/92385ce)]
    * Fix a *Table column x established by element 'col' has no cells beginning in it* HTML validation error.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/951bcaf)]

## Packages reviewed and fixed, and bugs filed

* Bernhard M. Wiedemann:
    * [libqt5-qtdeclarative](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-74532) ([ASLR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization) / uninitialised memory written to output file)

* [Chris Lamb](https://chris-lamb.co.uk/):
    * [#925191](https://bugs.debian.org/925191) filed against [toil](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/toil) ([filed and merged upstream](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/toil/pull/2563))
    * [#925192](https://bugs.debian.org/925192) filed against [libappindicator](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/libappindicator).

## Test framework development

We operate a comprehensive [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)-based testing framework that powers [tests.reproducible-builds.org](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org). This week, Mattia Rizzolo:

* Fixed the `dsa-check-running-kernel` script after [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com] updated their packages.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/f94d787c)]
* Do not blindly forward the `jenkins@` emails, otherwise [procmail](http://www.procmail.org/) cannot filter them (breaking our `email2irc` script).&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/12fa047e)]
* Gave Vagrant Cascadian root everywhere.&nbsp;[[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/a170f7ee)]
