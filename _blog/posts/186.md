* [FIXME](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-mtools/2018-11/msg00004.html)

* [FIXME](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xdg/desktop-file-utils/issues/12)

* tests.r-b.o: Holger switched all the profitbricks amd64 and i386 build nodes to only use squid running on pb1 or pb10 now (depending on the pb datacenter they are in). this might have produced some build failures today (which will be automatically retried) but fixed the problems with squid running in the future (or rather, on nodes which sometimes run in teh future and sometimes today...), which we've rarely have seen. this complements what Holger did a few weeks ago for arm64. (see #909838)

* Myon mentioned https://reviews.llvm.org/D49466

* WIP patches for postgresql-hll: [Pass COPT and PROFILE to CXXFLAGS as well](https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/20181113104005.GA32154%40msg.credativ.de)

* Holger noticed and filed #913658: reproducible: broken links on packages pages

* t.r-b.o:
 * https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/buster/amd64/pkg_set_cloud-image.html and https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/buster/amd64/pkg_set_cloud-image_build-depends.html are two new package sets we're tracking
