* Eric Myhre gave a talk titled [Path-agnostic binaries, co-installable libraries, and How To Have Nice Things](https://media.ccc.de/v/ASG2018-204-path-agnostic_binaries_co-installable_libraries_and_how_to_have_nice_things) - featuring content-addressable file arrangements that benefit from reproducible builds.

* [FIXME](https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/changelog/pull-requests/1/please-make-the-references-reproducible/diff)

* Bernhard M. Wiedemann wrote https://github.com/bmwiedemann/reproducibleopensuse/blob/master/autoprovenance to help to understand how and where unreproducible files are created. The tool is still very early in its development and is ment to be distribution agnostic, however currently it depends on rpbbuild-strace and as such is only useful for RPM based distros. Which in turn means this might be a good starting point for someone to get involved in Reproducible Builds, by making this useful tool available to other projects.
