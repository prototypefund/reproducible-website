Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday September 30 and Saturday October 6 2018:

* Yet another reminder that the **fourth Reproducible Builds summit will be taking place between 11th—13th December 2018** in Paris at [Mozilla](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Paris)'s offices. If you are interested in attending please send an email to `holger@layer-acht.org`. More details can also be found on the [corresponding event page](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/paris2018/) of our website.

* In addition, Mariusz Zaborski will [present a talk on reproducible builds](https://twitter.com/BSidesWarsaw/status/1047426094117339136/photo/1) on the 13th October at [Security BSides Warsaw 2018](https://securitybsides.pl/).

* Eric Myhre gave a talk titled [Path-agnostic binaries, co-installable libraries, and How To Have Nice Things](https://media.ccc.de/v/ASG2018-204-path-agnostic_binaries_co-installable_libraries_and_how_to_have_nice_things) at [All Systems Go 2018](https://all-systems-go.io/) in Berlin, Germany featuring "content addressable splays" that benefit from reproducible builds.

* Bernhard M. Wiedemann wrote [autoprovenance](https://github.com/bmwiedemann/reproducibleopensuse/blob/master/autoprovenance) to help to understand how and where unreproducible files are created. Whilst it is meant to be distribution-agnostic it currently only works with [rpmbuild-strace](https://github.com/bmwiedemann/reproducible-faketools/blob/master/bin/rpmbuild-strace) and as such is more useful for RPM-based distros.

* [Marek Marczykowski-Górecki](https://github.com/marmarek) reported on [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/) progress on [achieving reproducible installation ISO images](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-installer-qubes-os/pull/26).

* Mattia Rizzolo [uploaded diffoscope version `103`](https://tracker.debian.org/news/992782/accepted-diffoscope-103-source-into-unstable/) to Debian unstable incorporate a [fix by Chris Lamb to support gnumeric 1.12.43](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/4758809).

* [Guillem Jover](https://www.hadrons.org/~guillem/) provided a patch to `strip-nondeterminism` to [remove some old `Date::Parse` code](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/strip-nondeterminism/commit/d96687d) which was subsequently [uploaded to Debian unstable](https://tracker.debian.org/news/993001/accepted-strip-nondeterminism-0043-1-source-all-into-unstable/) by Chris Lamb.

* Chris Lamb reviewed 35 Debian packages. In addition, 6 were updated and 15 were removed in this week, adding to [our knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html). Chris Lamb also added two issue toolchain issues ([`path_in_texi_figure_documentation`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/909c593b) & [`randomness_in_python_changelog_references`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/4182192d)) and Peter Wu [updated the documentation for cmake](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/7ad02499).

    * [Allow squid access from other codethink-hosted nodes](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/d7d7dd78).
    * [Install debootstrap from `stretch-backports` on the Ubuntu nodes as debootstrap `1.0.78+nmu1ubuntu1.6` cannot install on `unstable` anymore](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/9d0ac728).

    * Now that the projects have re-joined, merge the [LEDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEDE) work back in so that we only have OpenWrt tests ([1](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/300e8fe4), [2](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/a41ea551), [3](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/f1aa3b37), [4](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/e63ae263), [5](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/725ce40c), [6](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/0d8ad724))

    * [Document that every build is done under a `umask(2)` of `0022`](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/2b3738a1), because this is enforced by the OpenWrt build system.
