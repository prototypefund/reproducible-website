* Eric Myhre gave a talk titled [Path-agnostic binaries, co-installable libraries, and How To Have Nice Things](https://media.ccc.de/v/ASG2018-204-path-agnostic_binaries_co-installable_libraries_and_how_to_have_nice_things) - featuring content-addressable splays (file arrangements) that benefit from reproducible builds.

* Bernhard M. Wiedemann wrote https://github.com/bmwiedemann/reproducibleopensuse/blob/master/autoprovenance to help to understand how and where unreproducible files are created. The tool is still very early in its development and is meant to be distribution agnostic, however currently it cooperates with rpmbuild-strace and as such is more useful for RPM based distros. Which in turn means this might be a good starting point for someone to get involved in Reproducible Builds, by making this useful tool available to other projects.

* Marek Marczykowski-GÃ³recki gave a little update on Qubes OS: there is a progress with reproducible installation ISO (given the same set of input packages): see https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-installer-qubes-os/pull/26 for details.
