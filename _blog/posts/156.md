Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday April 15 and Saturday April 21 2018:

* Holger Levsen [announced preliminary result of our poll for our logo](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-April/000881.html) which was [subsequently verified](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-April/000883.html) by Chris Lamb. The winner was "#6", shown above.

* Chris Lamb will present at [foss-north 2018](http://foss-north.se/2018/) on Monday April 23rd in Gothenburg, Sweden to speak about [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org), our in-depth "diff-on-steroids" to analyse reproducible issues in packages. He will then be keynoting at [FLOSSUK 2018](https://www.flossuk.org/membership/spring-conference-2018/) in Edinburgh, Scotland on April 26th to speak about reproducible builds more generally.

* Jan Bundesmann, Reiner Herrmann and Holger Levsen wrote an article about Reproducible Builds titled [*Aus der Schablone*](https://www.heise.de/select/ix/2018/5/1524884258999635) (*"From the template"*) for the May issue of the German "iX" magazine.

* Holger Levsen began a discussion with the [Debian System Administrators](https://dsa.debian.org/) regarding redirecting this blog in the future away from the (deprecated) [Alioth](https://wiki.debian.org/Alioth) service. Chris Lamb subsequently started on the migration work.
