Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday December 9th and Saturday December 15th 2018:

* We had an exteremely rewarding and productive [Reproducible Builds summit](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/paris2018/) in Paris, France. Thank you to all who participated and helped organise the event.

    A full and in-depth report about the event is being prepared but in the meantime Jelle van der Waa [published a blog post](https://vdwaa.nl/arch-reproducible-build-summit-18.html#arch-reproducible-build-summit-18) with a brief report of the event from an [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) perspective and Bernhard M. Wiedemann [posted his own report](https://lizards.opensuse.org/2018/12/17/report-from-the-reproducible-builds-summit-2018/) to his [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) blog.

    We would also like to thank [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/), [Ford Foundation](https://www.fordfoundation.org/), [Google Open Source Research](https://opensource.google.com/), [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) and [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/) for sponsoring the event and for [Aspiration Tech](https://aspirationtech.org) for their facilitation work.

* Following on from a session at our summit, Bernhard M. Wiedemann started a thread on our mailing list discussing [Reproducible Builds through a mathemetical formalism perspective](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-December/001327.html).

* [Chris Lamb](https://chris-lamb.co.uk/) updated the [Lintian](https://lintian.debian.org/) quality-assurance tool for Debian packages to check for files that reference the build path. ([#916021](https://bugs.debian.org/916021))

* Bernhard M. Wiedemann noticed that [Qt's `rcc` had finally merged](https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/243636/) the patch to use [`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`](https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/) for reproducible `.qrc` files. In addition, Chris Lamb filed Debian bug [#916425](https://bugs.debian.org/916425) with a patch for [`python-ruffus`](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/python-ruffus) to fix a reproducibility issue there too.

* [Jelle van der Waa](https://vdwaa.nl), inspired by Bernhard's [recent RPM ecosystem update](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-December/001301.html), posted [an equivalent update of Reproducible Builds](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-December/001311.html) in [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) to [our mailing list](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/).

* Bernhard M. Wiedemann [submitted strip-nondeterminism-1.0.0](https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/658688) to openSUSE.

* Chris Lamb started to merge in new style guide to our project website, adding an example "work in progress" typography page [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/00369e5)] and also corrected some references to "non-determinism" [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/58643dd)]. In addition, [Holger Levsen](http://layer-acht.org/) updated our project's website to add [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com/) as an attendee of [our summit in Paris](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/paris2018/) [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/42f2b57)] and added a group photo taken by [Morten Linderud](Morten Linderud) [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/24edf47)].


[diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/) development
-------------------------------------------------

[diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/) is our in-depth "diff-on-steroids" utility which helps us diagnose reproducibility issues in packages. There was considerable activity this week, including contibutions from:

* Chris Lamb:
    * Fix a `test_mozzip_compressed_files` test failure under [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/). ([#916353](https://bugs.debian.org/916353))
    * Calculate the path to a test `.icc` file using `data()` to avoid a "Fixtures are not meant to be called directly" warning/error. ([#916226](https://bugs.debian.org/916226))
    * Drop debbindiff `Breaks/Replaces`. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/7472c24)]
    * Use `File.file_header` to simplify file detection. ([[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/aa55c7f)], [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/f0ae5eb)] & [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/f581b2d)])
    * Correct a "positives" typo. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/237ca36)]

* Holger Levsen:
    * Clarify that upstream issues should be now reported via Salsa. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/f0bf14f)]

* Joachim Breitner:
    * Add support for comparing WebAssembly modules. ([!17](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/merge_requests/17))

* Mattia Rizzolo:
    * Try matching for `MozillaZipFile` before `ZipFile`. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/a069181)]

Chris Lamb also overhauled the [diffoscope.org](https://diffoscope.org) website, updating the design [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope-website/commit/256ce81)] as well as informing users that they should [file issues on salsa](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/issues) [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope-website/commit/86ca32a)] and adding corresponding link to our [Salsa registration instruction](https://reproducible-builds.org/contribute/salsa/) [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope-website/commit/7e957d5)].
