Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday January 28 and Saturday February 3 2018:


Reproducible work in other projects
-----------------------------------

* Whilst it has been active for some time, the `#archlinux-reproducible` Freenode IRC channel is the home to Reproducible efforts on Arch.

* [Please](https://please.build/) is a cross-language build system with an emphasis on high performance, extensibility and reproduceability. It supports a number of popular languages and can automate nearly any aspect of your build process.

* Jim MacArthur [posted about Reproducible Builds in BuildStream](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/buildstream-list/2018-February/msg00003.html).
