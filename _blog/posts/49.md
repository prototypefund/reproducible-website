builds](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds) effort between March 27th and April 2nd:

Toolchain fixes
---------------

 * Emmanuel Bourg uploaded [ant](https://tracker.debian.org/ant)/1.9.6-2 which makes the Tstamp task support the `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` variable, and the Javadoc task use `en` as the default locale if none was specified and `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` is set.

-----------------------------
The i386 builders are now testing packages on i386 for reproducibility. It will probably take 4 weeks until everything has been build twice, on this arch. (h01ger)
