Documentation updates
---------------------

Bernhard Wiedemann started [The Unreproducible
Package](https://github.com/bmwiedemann/theunreproduciblepackage) which "is
meant as a practical way to demonstrate the various ways that software can
break reproducible builds using just low level primitives without requiring
external existing programs that implement these primitives themselves.

It is structured so that one subdirectory demonstrates one class of issues in
some variants observed in the wild."


Reproducible work in other projects
-----------------------------------

Hush, a fork of ZCash, [opened an issue](https://github.com/MyHush/hush/issues/60)
into reproducible builds.

A [new
tag](https://lintian.debian.org/tags/latest-changelog-entry-without-new-date.html)
was added to lintian (lint checker for Debian packages) to ensure that
changelog entry timestamps are strictly increasing. This avoids certain
real-world issues with identical timestamps, documented in Debian [#843773](https://bugs.debian.org/843773).
