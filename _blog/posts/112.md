tests.reproducible-builds.org
-----------------------------

As you might have noticed, Debian `stretch` was released last week. Since then, Mattia and Holger renamed our `testing` suite to `stretch` and added a `buster` suite so that we keep our historic results for `stretch` visible and can continue our development work as usual. In this sense, happy hacking on buster; may it become the best Debian release ever and hopefully the first reproducible one!

- Vagrant Cascadian:
  - Proposed [reducing the number of concurrent builds each armhf machine runs](https://bugs.debian.org/864686),
    to reduce out-of-memory errors, crashes and false positives with FTBFS
    on     `armhf`, reducing the number of `armhf` build workers from 70 to 51.
- Valerie Young: Add highlighting in navigation for the new nodes health pages.
- Mattia Rizzolo:
  - Do not dump database ACL in the backups.
  - Deduplicate `SSLCertificateFile` directive into the `common-directives-ssl` macro
  - Apache: t.r-b.o: redirect /testing/ to /stretch/
  - db: s/testing/stretch/g
  - Start adding code to test [buster](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/buster/index_suite_amd64_stats.html)...
- Holger Levsen:
  - Update `README.infrastructure` to explain who has `root` access where.
  - reproducible_nodes_info.sh: correctly recognize zero builds per day.
  - Add build nodes health overview page, then split it in three: [health overview](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_nodes_health.html), [daily munin graphs](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_nodes_daily_graphs.html) and [weekly munin graphs](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_nodes_weekly_graphs.html).
  - reproducible_worker.sh: improve handling of systemctl timeouts.
  - reproducible_build_service: sleep less and thus restart failed workers sooner.
  - Replace ftp.(de|uk|us).debian.org with `deb.debian.org` everywhere.
  - Performance page: also show local problems with `_build_service.sh` (which are autofixed after a maximum of 133.7 minutes).
  - Rename _nodes_info job to _html_nodes_info.
  - Add new node health check jobs, split off from maintenance jobs, run every 15 minutes.
    - Add two new checks: 1. for correct future (2019 is incorrect atm, and we sometimes got that). 2.) for writeable /tmp (sometimes happens on borked armhf nodes).
  - Add jobs for testing `buster`.
  - s/testing/stretch/g in all the code.
  - Finish the code to deal with [buster](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/buster/index_suite_amd64_stats.html).
  - Teach `jessie` and Ubuntu 16.04 how to `debootstrap` `buster`.

Axel Beckert is currently in the process of setting up eight [LeMaker HiKey960 boards]((http://www.96boards.org/product/hikey960/). These boards were sponsored by [Hewlett Packard Enterprise](https://www.hpe.com/) and will be hosted by the [SOSETH](https://sos.ethz.ch/) students association at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/). Thanks to everyone involved here and also thanks to Martin Michlmayr and Steve Geary who initiated getting these boards to us.
