What happened in the [Reproducible
Builds](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds) effort between Sunday October 2 and Saturday October 8 2016:

Media coverage
--------------

* There was an [interesting discussion on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12666923) about diverse double-compilation that touched on reproducible builds.

Events
------

* Vagrant Cascadian gave an impromptu talk about reproducible builds at [CAT Barcamp](catbarcamp.org) on 8th October.

* Holger discussed Reproducible coreboot at [coreboot.berlin](https://coreboot.berlin). Unlike other projects, coreboot doesn't do binary releases because there have been many instances of people taking some incorrect coreboot binary, flashed it and bricked their machinesâ€¦ The end idea is that coreboot will simply release `.buildinfo` files (and still no binaries) instead.

Weekly QA work
--------------

During of reproducibility testing, some FTBFS bugs have been detected and
reported by:

 - Chris Lamb (12)

tests.reproducible-builds.org
-----------------------

Debian:

- The data in `reproducible-tracker.json` (which is fed to `tracker.d.o` and DDPO) has been changed to contain data from testing as the build path variations we introduced for unstable are not yet ready for wider consumption. For testing/stretch we recomment to create reproducible packages by rebuilding in the same path. (h01ger)
- Various reproducibility statistics for testing/stretch have been added to the [dashboard view](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/reproducible.html). (h01ger)
- The [repository comparison page](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_repositories.html) has been improved to only show obsolete packages if they exist (which they currently don't as we have rebuilt everything from the plain Debian repos, except for our modified `dpkg` due to <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/138409">#138409</a> and <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/787980">#787980</a>). (h01ger)
- All `armhf` boards are now using Linux kernels provided by Debian. (vagrant)

Misc.
-----

This week's edition was written by Chris Lamb, Holger Levsen & Vagrant Cascadian and reviewed by a bunch of Reproducible Builds folks on IRC.
