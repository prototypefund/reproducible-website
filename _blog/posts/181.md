Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday October 7 and Saturday October 13 2018:

* Holger gave a talk about [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/) at the [MirageOS](https://mirage.io/) [hacker retreat](https://retreat.mirage.io). This resulted in three bugs being filed ([#910540](https://bugs.debian.org/910540) (*backtrace when using diffoscope on MacOS*, [#910542](https://bugs.debian.org/910542) (*Please add better support for OCaml object files*), & [#910541](https://bugs.debian.org/910541) (*Filing bugs on diffoscope is cumbersome for non-Debian contributors*).

* In the upcoming weeks, Chris Lamb and kpcyrd will be attending [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/) to work with students from the *Application Security* course on the topic of reproducible builds.

* Richard Purdie reported that the [Yocto Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) now offers [reproducible builds for arbitrary paths and build users](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-October/001203.html). This is only tested with `core-image-sato`, an [X-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System) graphical image but means the core system components are reproducible, providing a solid base that further improvements can be made from.

* [Mes](https://gitlab.com/janneke/mes) (a Scheme-based compiler for our "sister" [bootstrappable builds](http://bootstrappable.org) effort) [announced their 0.18 release](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2018-10/msg00000.html).

* Mattia Rizzolo updated the [Contribute](https://reproducible-builds.org/contribute/) section on [our website](https://reproducible-builds.org/), removing some references from the now-deprecated [Alioth](https://wiki.debian.org/Alioth) Debian service. He also [added a handy link to file a new bug report](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope-website/commit/d1859e5) on the [diffoscope.org](https://diffoscope.org/) website.

* disorderfs (our [FUSE](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse)-based filesystem that deliberately introduces non-determinism into filesystem metadata) version `0.5.4-2` was [uploaded to Debian unstable](https://tracker.debian.org/news/995207/accepted-disorderfs-054-2-source-into-unstable/) by Holger Levsen. It [included contributions already covered in previous weeks](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/disorderfs/commits/debian/0.5.4-2) but also include some fixes to the the `debian/watch` file ([1](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/disorderfs/commit/494a411), [2](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/disorderfs/commit/e099a4e) & [3](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/disorderfs/commit/4c803a4)) and was migrated to [use the new `debhelper-compat (= 11)`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/disorderfs/commit/9c648d3) notation.

* Chris Lamb reviewed 25 Debian packages and 28 were removed in this week, adding to [our knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html).Chris also added a new [`timestamps_in_episode_files_generated_by_jxc`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/0eab9dbe) toolchain issue and [expanded the comments](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/92bdc5bb) for [`translations_missing_in_desktop_files`](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/issues/unstable/translations_missing_in_desktop_files_issue.html).

* strip-nondeterminism version `0.043-2` was [uploaded to Debian unstable](https://tracker.debian.org/news/995203/accepted-strip-nondeterminism-0043-2-source-into-unstable/) by Mattia Rizzolo. It [included contributions already covered in previous weeks](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/strip-nondeterminism/commits/debian/0.043-2) as well [using the new `debhelper-compat (= 11)` notation](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/strip-nondeterminism/commit/deba9e1) and [fixing the `debian/watch` file](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/strip-nondeterminism/commit/8c7200b) after moving from the now-deprecated [Alioth](https://wiki.debian.org/Alioth) Debian infrastructure.

Another brief reminder that another Reproducible Builds summit will be taking place between 11th—13th December 2018 in [Mozilla](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Paris)'s offices in Paris. If you are interested in attending please send an email to `holger@layer-acht.org`. More details can also be found on the [corresponding event page](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/paris2018/) of our website.


diffoscope development
----------------------

[diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/) is our in-depth "diff-on-steroids" utility which helps us diagnose reproducibility issues in packages) was updated this week, including contributions from:

* Chris Lamb:
    * [Use `str.startswith(...)` over `str.index(...) == 0` in the Macho comparator to prevent tracebacks if text cannot be found on the line](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/56f8215). ([#910540](https://bugs.debian.org/910540)).

* Marek Marczykowski-Górecki:
    * [Handle FAT filesystems with the `fsimage` comparator](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/da3b97a).
    * [Add a test for FAT `fsimage` comparator](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/575f99b).

* Mattia Rizzolo:
    * Adjust some build dependencies: Add [`linux-image-amd64 [amd64]` to allow the SquashFS tests to run](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/225a30b) and [`linux-image-generic`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/b90bd2f).
    * Adjust "autopkgtest" dependencies: Add [`linux-image-amd64`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/c6d2511) as well as [the optional Python modules](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/71eb7e3).
    * [Move the list of optional Python packages to `setup.py` and have `dh_python3` check the generated `requires.txt](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/1e109bc).
    * [Add a `Build-Conflicts` against `graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/dc3634e).
    * [Temporarily drop `{Build,Test}-Depends` for `apktool` and `oggvideotools`; they are not available in `buster` at the moment](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/018b7ae).
    * [Rename `procyon-decompiler` to `procyon`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/d7ec996),

Test framework development
--------------------------

There were a large number of updates to our [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)-based testing framework that powers [tests.reproducible-builds.org](tests.reproducible-builds.org) by Holger Levsen this month, including:

* [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)-specific changes:
    * [Temporarily disable building with `build2` and `build` as the jenkins user](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/e76b96c6). This was an attempt to diagnose a path-variation issue.
    * [Also call `printenv` before the builds to diagnose path issue](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/bed37f55).
    * [Always force PATH to match `makechrootpkg`](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/8d2d1b29), else Arch Linux builds vary as the include the current PATH in the build results.
    * [Increase timeout for running `diffoscope` to one hour](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/628e4da5).
    * [Trap "exit" so we properly end the `schroot` sessions on failures](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/43fa8d16).
    * [Include the number of recent builds on the `recent_builds.html` page](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/c30aaa7e).
    * [Drop an unused variable](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/53ab78ff).

* [Debian GNU/Linux](https://www.debian.org/)-specific changes:

    * Re-add [8 `i386` builders](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/af220237) and [8 `arm64` builders](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/0cb66d2b) as the relevant build nodes are not using all the memory they have available to them.

* Misc/generic changes:

    * Add a new [job health page](https://jenkins.debian.net/userContent/jenkins_job_health.html) ([1](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/e41356e1), [2](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/004ab3c3), [3](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/7640a773), [4](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/7836b079), etc.)
    * [Warn on  files  greater than 8G in `/var/log` and fail maintenance job if files greater than 32G are found](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/ec09e960).
    * [Add health-check and maintenance jobs for the `pb10` node](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/2716e823).
    * [Only check for outdated running kernels once per day; the maintenance job also checks this](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/4d6b2a77).
    * [Fix path to `/var/spool/squid/` for compatibility with `stretch`](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/a492bd5b).
    * Perform some node maintenance. ([1](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/1332da65), [2](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/9993e59c), [3](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/bd143021), etc.).

In addition, Mattia Rizzolo performed some node administration ([1](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/c8731d91), [2](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/daeeb033)).
