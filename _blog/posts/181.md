* FIXME: janneke_gnu: GNU Mes 0.18 released

* Holger gave a talk about diffoscope at the [mirage.io hack retreat](https://retreat.mirage.io) which resulted in three bugs being filed against diffoscope:
  - #910540 backtrace when using diffoscope on macOS (brew)
    - immediatly fixed by Chris.
  - #910541 diffoscope] diffoscope: filing bugs on diffoscope is cumbersome for non-Debian contributors
  - #910542 better support for OCaml object files via ocamlobjinfo

* Richard Purdie [reported on our mailinglist](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-October/001203.html) 
  that the Yocto Project now has reproducible builds for arbitrary paths and
  build users. This is only tested with our core-image-sato level which is an
  X based graphical image but means our core system components are reproducible
  and means there is a solid base further improvements can be made from.
