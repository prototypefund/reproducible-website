What happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds) effort between Sunday December 11 and Saturday December 17 2016:

Reproducible builds world summit
--------------------------------

The [2nd Reproducible Builds World Summit](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/berlin2016/) was held in Berlin, Germany on December 13th-15th. The event was a great success with enthusiastic participation from an extremely diverse number of projects. Many thanks to our sponsors for making this event possible!

Elsewhere in Debian
------------------

* Chris Lamb submitted a [patch for ``dak`` to preserve ``.buildinfo`` files](https://lists.debian.org/debian-dak/2016/12/msg00011.html) on the local ftp-master filesystem. This is a temporary measure to prevent some "historical" data loss; the files are currently being silently discarded.

trydiffoscope development
-------------------------

- trydiffoscope was split from the main diffoscope repository by Chris Lamb so that the two projects can be released independently and so that trydiffoscope can more easily be available on PyPI. It also simplifies the diffoscope packaging.

- trydiffoscope 64 was uploaded to unstable by Chris Lamb.

Misc.
-----

This week's edition was written by Chris Lamb and reviewed by a bunch of Reproducible Builds folks on IRC and via email.
