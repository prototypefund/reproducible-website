Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday May 28 and Saturday June 3 2017:

Past and upcoming events
------------------------

- On June 9th, Chris Lamb will present at the [Hong Kong Open Source Conference 2017](http://hkoscon.org/2017/) on reproducible builds.

- We restarted our IRC meetings, now with a monthly schedule where we meet on the first Thursday of the month at a varying time. Our [next meeting will be on the first 6th of July](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/reproducible-builds/Week-of-Mon-20170529/008785.html) at 17:00 UTC. At the June meeting we had the following agenda, and if you are interested there is an [automated summary](http://meetbot.debian.net/reproducible-builds/2017/reproducible-builds.2017-06-01-15.59.html) and full logs too. 

  1. Introductions
  2. Feedback for the [reproducible.json spec format](http://rb.zq1.de/spec/json-format.txt) - is that suitable for Guix and F-Droid as well? LEDE/OpenWrt? Coreboot?
  3. writing parser + user interface for `reproducible.json`
  4. tests.r-b.o/Debian once Stretch has been released
  5. Reproducible Builds Summit 2017
  6. Next meeting
  7. Any other business

Documentation updates
---------------------

- Holger [added a link to the blog post with a report about the recent hackathon](https://anonscm.debian.org/git/reproducible/reproducible-website.git/commit/?id=c728f51) to our website.

Toolchain development and fixes
-------------------------------

- Chris Lamb wrote a proof-of-concept implementation for [#863622](https://bugs.debian.org/863622) ("apt: warn when installing packages that are not reproducible"). Try it, it's fun!

- Russ worked on making the [debian-policy package build reproducibly](https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/dbnpolicy/policy.git/commit/?id=d1103ecf57398ac8ef6e0dd123150b4f6eebc4d0) which is a good opportunity to shamelessly plug that [#844431](https://bugs.debian.org/844431) ("debian-policy: Packages should be reproducible") is still a work in progress.

tests.reproducible-builds.org
-----------------------------

Mattia Rizzolo:

 - `packages-tests`: go back to the shorter way of specifying JUnit jobs.
 - `update_jdn`: call jenkins-jobs instead of jenkins-job-builder, as that's how it is named in 1.6.1 version.
 - Upload `jenkins-job-builder` 1.6.1-1~bpo8+1 to *jessie-backports*.

Daniel Kahn Gillmor:

 - Contribute a few typo fixes.

Vagrant Cascadian:

 - Update README to reflect switch to PostgreSQL (some time ago).
 - Add three new boards for `armhf` tests:
    - `ff64a-armhf-rb.debian.net`: Firefly-rk3399, Rockchip six-core (Cortex-A72 x2 + Cortex-A53 x4), 2GB RAM, USB-sata (future plans for native sata.)
    - `jtx1a-armhf-rb.debian.net`: Jetson-tx1, quad-core (big.LITTLE Cortex-A53/A57), ~3.5GB RAM, native SATA ~500GB disk
    - `odc2a-armhf-rb.debian.net`: Odroic-C2, quad-core (Cortex-A53), ~2GB ram, 128GB eMMC
 - Resurrect `rpi2c-armhf-rb.debian.net` (Raspberry PI 2B, broadcom bcm2836 quad-core (cortex-A7), 1GB RAM) from the dead.

Holger Levsen:

- Configure the `rc.local` service on all build nodes to only start when the network is actually up, as configuring half of them to run in the future requires networking to determine the real current date. See [Running Services After the Network is up](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/NetworkTarget/) if you want to learn more about networking with `systemd`. Somehow this doesn't work yet on the Ubuntu 16.05 `arm64` nodes; help welcome, either on `#debian-qa` or `#debian-reproducible`.
- Add `rpi2c` back to the `armhf` network.
- Also add `ff64a`, `odc2a` & `jtx1a` to the `armhf` network.
   - Add pbuilder/schroot-setup jobs for the new nodes.
   - Add 10 new `armhf` builder jobs.
   - Disable all build jobs on `odc2a` again as `haveged` segfaults on 4.12~rc2, which is needed for this board & setup.
- Reproducible_cleanup_nodes.sh: adapt for new build service
- Make [performance.html](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_performance.html) show if build jobs are down due to remote node problems and make code to count enabled jobs more robust.
- `reproducible_build_service`: Make it cope with disabled workers.
- `jenkins-master-wrapper`: Fail loudly if remote node is not accessible.
- Increase maximum scheduling queue sizes, to adjust for faster scheduler.
- New script, `init_node`, to initialize new build nodes (derived from refactored existing script).
- Update INSTALL documentation to reflect that we're testing `arm64` now too.

Misc.
-----

This week's edition was written by Chris Lamb, Bernhard M. Wiedemann and Holger Levsen & reviewed by a bunch of Reproducible Builds folks on IRC & the mailing lists.
