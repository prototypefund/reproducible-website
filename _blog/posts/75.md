What happened in the [Reproducible
Builds](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds) effort between Sunday September 25 and Saturday October 1 2016:

Statistics…
-----------

For the first time, we reached 91% reproducible packages in our testing framework on
[testing/amd64](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/testing/index_suite_amd64_stats.html) using a determistic build path. (This is what we recommend to make packages in Stretch reproducible.)
For unstable/amd64, where we additionally test for reproducibility across
different build paths we are at almost 76% again.

IRC meetings
------------

We have a [poll to set a time for a new regular IRC meeting](https://deb.li/2vse).
If you would like to attend, please input your available times and we will try
to accommodate for you.

There was a trial IRC meeting on Friday, 2016-09-31 1800 UTC. Unfortunately, we
did not activate [meetbot](http://meetbot.debian.net/debian-reproducible/2016/).
Despite this participants consider the meeting a success as several topics where
discussed (eg changes to IRC notifications of tests.r-b.o) and the meeting stayed
within one our length.

Toolchain development and fixes
-------------------------------

Michael Meskes uploaded [bsdmainutils](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/bsdmainutils)/9.0.11 to unstable with a fix
for [#830259](https://bugs.debian.org/830259) based on Reiner Herrmann's patch.  This fixed [locale_dependent_symbol_order_by_lorder](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/issues/unstable/locale_dependent_symbol_order_by_lorder_issue.html) issue in the affected packages ([freebsd-libs](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/freebsd-libs), [mmh](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/mmh)).

[devscripts](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/devscripts)/2.16.8 was uploaded to unstable. It includes a `debrepro` 
script by Antonio Terceiro which is similar in purpose to `reprotest` but more
lightweight; specific to Debian packages and without support for virtual servers
or configurable variations.

Weekly QA work
--------------

As part of reproducibility testing, FTBFS bugs have been detected and reported
by:

 - Adrian Bunk (3)
 - Chris Lamb (12)
 - Lucas Nussbaum (3)
 - Sebastian Reichel (1)


diffoscope development
----------------------

A new version of diffoscope `61` was
[uploaded](http://changelogs.debian.net/diffoscope#60) to unstable by Chris
Lamb. It included
[contributions](https://anonscm.debian.org/git/reproducible/diffoscope.git/log/?h=61)
from:

- Ximin Luo:
  - Improve the CLI `--help` text and add an `--output-empty` option.
- Chris Lamb:
  - Add a progress bar and show it if stdout is a TTY. You can read more about
    it [here](https://chris-lamb.co.uk/posts/diffoscope-progress-bar). It can
    also be read by higher-level programs via the `--status-fd` CLI option.
- Maria Glukhova:
  - Behaviour improvements in the case of OS-level errors.
- Mattia Rizzolo:
  - Testing and packaging improvements.

Post-release there were further contributions from:

- Chris Lamb:
  - Code architecture improvements.
- Maria Glukhova:
  - Testing improvements.


reprotest development
---------------------

A new version of reprotest `0.3.2` was
[uploaded](http://changelogs.debian.net/reprotest#0.3.2) to unstable by Ximin
Luo. It included
[contributions](https://anonscm.debian.org/git/reproducible/diffoscope.git/log/?h=0.3.2)
from:

- Ximin Luo:
  - Add a `--diffoscope-arg` CLI option to pass extra args to diffoscope.

Post-release there were further contributions from:

- Chris Lamb:
  - Code quality improvements.


tests.reproducible-builds.org
-----------------------------

- Hans-Christoph Steiner continued work on setting up reproducible tests for F-Droid.
- Holger cleaned up the script creating [the page showing breakages](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_breakages.html), so that it now also cleans up some of the breakage it finds.
- IRC notifications about diffoscope crashes and artifacts available for investigations have been dropped; instead the [breakages page](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_breakages.html) has a permanent pointer. (h01ger)
- IRC notifications from the automatic package scheduler and status changes for packages have been moved -- as a temporary trial -- to #debian-reproducible-changes on irc.oftc.net (Mattia).


Misc.
-----

This week's edition was written by Ximin Luo, Holger Levsen & Chris Lamb and reviewed by a bunch of Reproducible Builds folks on IRC.
