1 issue type has been updated:

- Add [build_path_captured_in_assembly_objects](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/issues/unstable/build_path_captured_in_assembly_objects_issue.html)


diffoscope development
----------------------

- Juliana Oliveira Rodrigues:
  - Fix comparisons between different container types not comparing inside
    files. It was caused by falling back to binary comparison for different
    file types even for unextracted containers.
  - Add many tests for the fixed behaviour.
  - Other code quality improvements.
- Chris Lamb:
  - Various code quality and style improvements, some of it using Flake8.
- Mattia Rizzolo:
  - Add a check to prevent installation with python < 3.4


reprotest development
---------------------

- Ximin Luo:
  - Split up the very large ``__init__.py`` and remove obsolete earlier code.
  - Extend the syntax for the ``--variations`` flag to support parameters to
    certain variations like ``user_group``, and document examples in README.
  - Add a ``--vary`` flag for the new syntax and deprecate ``--dont-vary``.
  - Heavily refactor internals to support > 2 builds.
  - Support >2 builds using a new ``--extra-build`` flag.
  - Properly sanitize ``artifact_pattern`` to avoid arbitrary shell execution.


trydiffoscope development
-------------------------

Version 65 was [uploaded to
unstable](http://metadata.ftp-master.debian.org/changelogs/main/t/trydiffoscope/trydiffoscope_65_changelog)
by Chris Lamb including these
[contributions](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/trydiffoscope/commits/debian/65):

- Chris Lamb:

Reproducible websites development
--------------------------------

- Holger Levsen:
  - Add a page for the [Reproducible Builds World Summit 3 in Berlin 2017](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/berlin2017/).

- Chris Lamb:
  - Moved [isdebianreproducibleyet.com](https://isdebianreproducibleyet.com) to HTTPS.
  - Updated the SSL certificate for [buildinfo.debian.net](https://buildinfo.debian.net).


tests.reproducible-builds.org
-----------------------------

- Vagrant Cascadian and Holger Levsen:
  - Added two armhf boards to the build farm. [#874682](https://bugs.debian.org/874682)
- Holger also:
  - use timeout to limit the diffing of the two build logs to 30min, which greatly
    reduced jenkins load again.
