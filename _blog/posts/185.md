Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday November 4 and Saturday November 10 2018:

* **We are excited to announce that the Reproducible Builds project [has joined the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://reproducible-builds.org/news/2018/11/08/reproducible-builds-joins-software-freedom-concervancy/)**!

   [![]({{ "/images/logos/sfconservancy-projects.png#center" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://reproducible-builds.org/news/2018/11/08/reproducible-builds-joins-software-freedom-concervancy/)

   [Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/about/) not-for-profit organization based in New York that helps promote, develop and defend free software projects, providing important services for its member projects.

   We can now can take directed donations and the Software Freedom Conservancy can also provide projects with basic legal services. The Reproducible Builds project is delighted and honoured to be associated with the outreach work and other work of the Conservancy project and look forward to a long and mutually beneficial relationship.

* Richard Parkins [posted a detailed message to our mailing list](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-November/001251.html) on the topic of algorithms used for comparing binary files in a way that makes the result easily consumable by humans. Most binary file comparators just compare bytes which don't detect deletions or insertions and is thus relevant to our work on [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/). He linked to some [example code on GitHub](https://github.com/rparkins999/bindiff).

* There was further discussion on Debian bug [#869184](https://bugs.debian.org/869184) which relates to `dpkg` generating source uploads including the build architecture in the name of the `.buildinfo` file can cause problems (eg. `_amd64.buildinfo`). This week, Salvatore Bonaccorso reported that the [Debian Security Team](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Security) were [hit by this issue again](https://bugs.debian.org/869184#60).

* On Tuesday 6th November, Chris Lamb [hosted a seminar and a lengthy Q&A session](http://talks.cam.ac.uk/talk/index/114232) at the William Gates Building at the University of Cambridge on reproducible builds as part of the [Computer Laboratory NetOS Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/).

* [Simon McVittie](http://smcv.pseudorandom.co.uk/) kindly [provided a patch](https://bugs.debian.org/901473#33) to our [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)-based testing framework that powers [tests.reproducible-builds.org](tests.reproducible-builds.org) to vary whether we apply the "merged `/usr`" directory scheme between builds. This is where the `/{bin,sbin,lib}/` directories are symbolic links to `/usr/{bin,sbin,lib}/`. It was subsequently merged by Holger Levsen and resulted in some variations in (at least) [quilt](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/rb-pkg/buster/amd64/diffoscope-results/quilt.html) and [systemd](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/rb-pkg/buster/amd64/diffoscope-results/systemd.html).

*  Chris Lamb updated `strip-nondeterminism` (our tool to post-process files to remove known non-deterministic output) to [catch invalid ZIP "local" field lengths](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/strip-nondeterminism/commit/e5f5008); we were previously inherently blindly trusting the value supplied in the ZIP file ([#803503](https://bugs.debian.org/803503)). In addition, he applied a patch from Emmanuel Bourg to [update the Javadoc handler to handle OpenJDK 11](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/strip-nondeterminism/commit/f745484) ([#913132](https://bugs.debian.org/913132)). He then subsequently uploaded version `0.044-1` [to Debian unstable](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1001570/accepted-strip-nondeterminism-0044-1-source-all-into-unstable/).

* Agustin Henze announced in a mail to the [`debian-devel`](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/) mailing list that [the new Debian CI pipeline](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2018/11/msg00183.html) includes support testing for reproducibility using `reprotest`. These tests are currently available on-demand and need to be set up individually.

* 33 Debian package reviews were added, 14 were updated and 33 were removed in this week, adding to [our knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html). Chris Lamb also updated the [`dc_created_timestamp_in_javadoc`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/1b314210) issue and added a new [`cflags_recorded_in_in_ada_ali_files`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/f3c2f1be) toolchain issue.

* If you're interested in attending the Reproducible Builds summit in Paris between 11thâ€”13th December [please see our event page](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/paris2018/).

* Our [report from last week](https://reproducible-builds.org/blog/posts/184/) was quoted in [LWN](https://lwn.net/)'s ["Distribution quotes of the week"](https://lwn.net/Articles/770530/).

diffoscope development
----------------------

[diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/) is our in-depth "diff-on-steroids" utility which helps us diagnose reproducibility issues in packages. This week, version `105` was [uploaded to Debian unstable](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1001952/accepted-diffoscope-105-source-into-unstable/) by Mattia Rizzolo. It [included contributions already covered in previous weeks](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commits/105) as well as new ones from:

* Chris Lamb:
    * [Don't assume all files called ".a" are ELF binaries because we specified a `FILE_EXTENSION_SUFFIX`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/cd4c642). This prevents a potential "Unrecognized archive format" traceback. ([#903446](https://bugs.debian.org/903446))
    * [Prevent errors when obtaining PDF metadata from files with multiple PDF metadata dictionary definition entries](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/9624319). ([#913315](https://bugs.debian.org/913315))

* Daniel Shahaf:
    * [Fix test failures with upcoming `file(1)` 5.35](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/0dfb818). Thanks to Christoph Biedl for the heads-up in advance. ([#912756](https://bugs.debian.org/912756))

* Mattia Rizzolo:
    * [Update GPG key](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/44e2c29).
    * [Fix a number of `flake8` and other deprecation warnings](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/becf992).

* Will Thompson:
    * [Add a `--list-missing-tools` option](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/339a431).


reproducible-website development
--------------------------------

There were a large number of changes to [our website](https://reproducibile-builds) this week:

* Bernhard M. Wiedemann:
    * [Update the "CMake" info](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/11828b3) to our page about the [`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/source-date-epoch/) environment variable.

    * [Netmrg bug 913195]( https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=913195)

In addition to that we had contributions from Deb Nicholson, Chris Lamb, Georg Faerber, Holger Levsen and Mattia Rizzolo *et al.* on the [press release regarding joining the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://reproducible-builds.org/news/2018/11/08/reproducible-builds-joins-software-freedom-concervancy/):


Test framework development
--------------------------

There were a large number of updates to our [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)-based testing framework that powers [tests.reproducible-builds.org](tests.reproducible-builds.org) by Holger Levsen this week, including:

* [Debian GNU/Linux](https://www.debian.org/)-specific changes:
    * [Use `pbuilder` from the "backports" repositories everywhere](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/2081b3a4).
    * [Force installation of `pbuilder` from bpo on ubuntu 16.04](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/d28a62fb)
    * Document that we vary by installing the `usr-merge` package [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/7902f640)] and add a link to the [corresponding Debian Wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/UsrMerge]) [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/fb44311e)].
    * Perform some node maintenance. ([1](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/6121cd22), [2](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/099a8de5), [3](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/2bc5747f), [4](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/410d530b))
