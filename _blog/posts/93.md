Here's what happened in the [Reproducible
Builds](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds) effort between Sunday
January 29 and Saturday February 4 2017:

Media coverage
--------------

Dennis Gilmore and Holger Levsen presented "Reproducible Builds and Fedora"
([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8oEg0p6QLE),
[Slides](http://reproducible.alioth.debian.org/presentations/2017-01-27-devconf.cz-reproducible-builds+fedora.pdf))
at [Devconf.cz](https://devconf.cz/) on February 27th 2017.

On February 1st,
[stretch/armhf](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/testing/index_suite_armhf_stats.html)
reached 90% reproducible packages in our test framework, so that now all four
tested architectures are &ge; 90% reproducible in stretch. Yay! For armhf this
means 22472 reproducible source packages (in main); for amd64, arm64 and i386
these figures are 23363, 23062 and 22607 respectively.

Chris Lamb [appeared on the Changelog
podcast](https://changelog.com/podcast/237) to talk about reproducible builds:

Holger Levsen pitched Reproducible Builds and our need for a
[logo](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/Logo) in the "Open Source Design"
room at FOSDEM 2017
([Video](https://video.fosdem.org/2017/AW1.121/osd_pitch_your_project.mp4),
09:36 - 12:00).

Reproducible work in other projects
-----------------------------------

We learned that the "slightly more secure" [Heads
firmware](https://github.com/osresearch/heads) (a Coreboot payload) [is now
reproducibly built regardless of host system or build
directory](https://twitter.com/qrs/status/826060202042494976/photo/1).
A picture says more than a thousand words:

Docker started [preliminary work](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/30611)
on making image builds reproducible.


Toolchain development and fixes
-------------------------------

Ximin Luo continued to write [code and test
cases](https://github.com/infinity0/rb-prefix-map) for the
`BUILD_PATH_PREFIX_MAP` environment variable. He also did extensive research on
cross-platform and cross-language issues with environment variables, filesystem
paths, and character encodings, and started preparing a draft specification
document to describe all of this.

Chris Lamb asked CPython to implement an environment variable
[PYTHONREVERSEDICTKEYORDER](http://bugs.python.org/issue29431) to add an
an option to reverse iteration order of items in a `dict`.  However this was
rejected because they are planning to formally fix this order in the next
language version.

Bernhard Wiedemann and Florian Festi [added
support](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/pull/143) for our
`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` environment variable, to the RPM Package Manager.

James McCoy uploaded <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/devscripts">devscripts</a> 2.17.1 with a change from Guillem
Jover for `dscverify(1)`, adding support for .buildinfo files. (Closes: <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/852801">#852801</a>)

Piotr OÅ¼arowski uploaded <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/dh-python">dh-python</a> 2.20170125 with a change from Chris
Lamb for a patch to fix <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/835805">#835805</a>.

Chris Lamb added documentation to diffoscope, strip-nondeterminism, disorderfs,
reprotest and trydiffoscope about uploading signed tarballs when releasing. He
also added a link to these on our website's [tools
page](https://reproducible-builds.org/tools/).
