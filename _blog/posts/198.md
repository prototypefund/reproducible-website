Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday February 3rd and Saturday February 9th 2019:

* This year, we intend to participate in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) 2019. If you are interested in becoming a student or mentor please see [our entry on the wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2019/Projects#SummerOfCode2019.2FProjects.2FReproducibleBuilds.Reproducible_Builds).

* In a blog post entitled "[Huawei case demonstrates importance of Free Software for security](https://fsfe.org/news/2019/news-20190205-01.en.html)" the [FSFE](https://fsfe.org) raised their voice in the [recent wider discussions regarding Huawei and 5G](https://www.zdnet.com/article/huawei-will-need-5-years-and-2b-to-resolve-uk-security-concerns-report/):

  > To establish trust in critical infrastructure like 5G, it is a crucial precondition that all software code powering those devices is published under a Free and Open Source Software licence" and furthermore points out that in case of binary distribution it is "necessary that there are reproducible builds.

* Reproducible Builds were present at both [FOSDEM 2019](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/) and [CopyLeftConf](https://2019.copyleftconf.org/) handing out t-shirts to contributors. The latter event was run under the auspices of the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/) who act as the Reproducible Builds project fiscal sponsor and are a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) charity focused on ethical technology and user freedom. If you like the work of the Conservancy or the Reproducible Builds project, please consider [becoming an official supporter](https://sfconservancy.org/supporter/).

* [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/) is our in-depth "diff-on-steroids" utility which helps us diagnose reproducibility issues in packages. This week, Chris Lamb adjust the behaviour to not look for adjacent `-dbgsym` Debian package files automatically anymore to align better with users' expectations. The existing behaviour can be re-enabled by specifying the new `--use-dbgsym` flag ([#44](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/issues/44) / [#920701](https://bugs.debian.org/920701)).

   Chris then [released and uploaded this as part of version `110`](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1028027/accepted-diffoscope-110-source-all-into-unstable/) but it was then reported that this introduced a regression where we had stopped using the `-dbgsym` packages when comparing `.buildinfo` or `.changes files`. This was subsequently fixed via [issue #46](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/issues/46).

* Bernhard M. Wiedemann a wrote [script to export CSV data](https://github.com/bmwiedemann/reproducibleopensuse/blob/master/rbplot.pl) of openSUSE reproducibility stats over time and [graphed it](https://rb.zq1.de/compare.factory/graph.png) using [Debian's graphing tool](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/blob/master/bin/make_graph.py).

* The [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix) "purely functional package manager" published a new "[r13y.com](https://r13y.com/)" single-page website that documents the current state of reproducibility in that distribution, a possible partner to [isdebianreproducibleyet.com](https://isdebianreproducibleyet.com/).

* On Tuesday February 26th Chris Lamb will speak at [Speck&Tech 31 "Open Security"](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/specktech-31-open-security-tickets-53503912643) on Reproducible Builds in Trento, Italy.

* Holger uploaded [koji version `1.16.1-1` to Debian](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1028398/accepted-koji-1161-1-source-into-unstable/) in order to package a new upstream version.

* Ten Debian package reviews were added, eleven were updated and nineteen were removed in this week, adding to [our knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html). Two issue types were updated by Chris Lamb, adding a fix for the [`randomness_in_documentation_underscore_downloads_generated_by_sphinx`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/9e2153f8) toolchain issue and also categorising a new [`randomness_in_documentation_graphviz_generated_by_sphinx`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/41675a8d) toolchain issue.

* Herv√© Boutemy made more updates to the [reproducible-builds.org](https://reproducible-builds.org) project website, including specifying the implications of using `-Dline.separator` with respect to UNIX line endings [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/3fdaa2f)]. In addition, Holger Levsen added a link to the "[who]({{ "/who/" | prepend: site.baseurl }})" page for the tests page for [NixOS](https://nixos.org/nix/) [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/9093f6c)] and Mykola Nikishov fixed a dead link to [how-to contribute]({{ "/contribute/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) page [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/b7ac922)].

## Packages reviewed and fixed, and bugs filed

    * [gnome-weather](https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/671146) (`libdir` made a `noarch` package vary between architectures)

* Chris Lamb:
    * [#921511](https://bugs.debian.org/921511) filed against [python-octaviaclient](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/python-octaviaclient) (forwarded and merged upstream [on Github](https://github.com/openstack/python-octaviaclient/pull/1) and [Gerrit](https://review.openstack.org/635194)).
    * [#921513](https://bugs.debian.org/921513) filed against [sphinx](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/sphinx) ([forwarded upstream](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/6028)).
