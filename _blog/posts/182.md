Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday October 14 and Saturday October 20 2018:

* Peter Wu [filed a bug report](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/18413) against the [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build tool to avoid embedding the build directory in an executable's [RPATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rpath).

* Chris Lamb [add support for comparing OCaml files via `ocamlobjinfo`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/bc92ac3) to [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/), our in-depth "diff-on-steroids" utility which helps us diagnose reproducibility issues in packages. closing Debian bug #910542. In addition, he added a note on how to [regenerate the `debian/tests/control.in` file](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/5574a4e) if it gets out of sync.

* Bernhard M. Wiedemann added two tests to disorderfs (our [FUSE](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse)-based filesystem that deliberately introduces non-determinism into filesystems) in order to check for various issues around the [`futimens` and `utimensat`](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/futimens.html) syscalls ([1](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/disorderfs/commit/326d2cc), [2](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/disorderfs/commit/d606f26)). This was also filed as Debian bug [#911281](https://bugs.debian.org/911281)

* Chris Lamb made a number of changes to [our website](https://reproducible-builds.org/), including adding his [recent NYU class talk](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/161f39b), [Holger's diffoscope talk the MirageOS hack retreat](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/ec50beb) and [Mariusz Zaborski's BSidesWarsaw 2018 talk](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/f547f34) to the [Resources](https://reproducible-builds.org/contribute/) page. Holger Levsen also made some commits on the website, updating the list of projects we'll be welcomeing at the [Reproducible Builds Summit in Paris](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/paris2018/) in December.

* This week, Chris Lamb added 25 package reviews, and 12 were updated & 13 were removed, adding to [our knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html). In addition, Bernhard M. Wiedemann [added a reference to a fix](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/706eef3c) for the [`translations_missing_in_desktop_files`](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/issues/unstable/translations_missing_in_desktop_files_issue.html) issue.

* Chris Murphy started an email thread on the [BtrFs](https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) filesystem's mailing list asking about [reproducible builds with BtrFs "seed" feature](https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-btrfs/msg83206.html).

Another reminder that the Reproducible Builds summit will be taking place between 11thâ€”13th December 2018 Paris at [Mozilla](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Paris)'s offices. If you are interested in attending, please send an email to `holger@layer-acht.org`. More details [can be found on the corresponding event page](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/paris2018/) of our website.
