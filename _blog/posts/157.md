Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday April 22 and Saturday April 28 2018:

* FIXME: I'd like to include some paragraphs celebrating 3 years of reproducible builds blogging, probably thanking and naming all contributors (so far) and also especially thanking lunar for starting this.

* FIXME: And I think it's also a good oppportunity to spell out the new blog url.

* FIXME: Maybe its also good to include the logo again, mentioning we still need to finalize the font and colors.

* On April 26th, Chris Lamb gave the keynote presentation at [FLOSSUK 2018](https://www.flossuk.org/membership/spring-conference-2018/) in Edinburgh, Scotland on reproducible builds and how it can prevent individual developers and centralised infrastructure from becoming targets from malicious actors.

* In addition, on Monday 23rd Chris at [foss-north 2018](http://foss-north.se/2018/speakers-and-talks.html#clamb) in Gothenburg, Sweden to speak about [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org), our in-depth "diff-on-steroids" to analyse reproducible issues in packages.

* Elio published a follow-up to our recent logo vote to [start the discussion on the typeface and colour scheme](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-April/000894.html) that will accompany it. Another vote is [likely to follow](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-April/000904.html).

- [Mes](https://gitlab.com/janneke/mes) (a Scheme-based compiler for our "sister" [bootstrappable builds](http://bootstrappable.org) effort) [announced their 0.13 release](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-April/000900.html).

* Chris Lamb migrated [this blog](https://reproducible-builds.org/blog/) and the related machinery from the deprecated [Alioth](https://wiki.debian.org/Alioth) (and Debian-branded) service to the more-generic `reproducible-builds.org` domain as well as made some cosmetic changes to the site itself ([...](https://anonscm.debian.org/git/reproducible/reproducible-website.git/commit/?id=4590ba0), etc.).

* 139 [package categorisations](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html) were added, 71 were updated and 38 were removed this week.

* Paul Wise [kindly sorted the Debian dependencies](https://anonscm.debian.org/git/reproducible/diffoscope.git/commit/?id=2c30de3) in the the [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org) codebase.
