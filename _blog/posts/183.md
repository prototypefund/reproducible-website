**If you are interested in attending the Reproducible Builds summit in Paris between 11th—13th December please see [our the event page](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/paris2018/).** In the meantime, here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday October 21 and Saturday October 27 2018:

* Allen "Gunner" Gunn — the facilitator at our summit meetings — discussed the Reproducible Builds [on a recent episode of The Changelog podcast](https://changelog.com/podcast/bonus-sustainoss-2018) at about 12m00s.

* [Lisa Neigut](https://basicbitch.software/) wrote a blog post entitled "[Reproducible builds with Bitcoin, Tor and Turtles](https://basicbitch.software/posts/2018-10-25-Reproducible-builds-with-Bitcoin-Tor-and-turtles.html)" referencing the [Turtles](https://github.com/theuni/turtles) project by Cory Fields as well as [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/).

* Bernhard M. Wiedemann posted a status update to the [opensuse-factory mailing list](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/) on the [current state of reproducible builds](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2018-10/msg00242.html) in [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/).

* Vagrant Cascadian [announced](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-October/001227.html) that he has [begun uploading `.buildinfo` files from the Debian archive](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=862073#39) to the experimental [buildinfo.debian.net](https://buildinfo.debian.net/) service.

* David A. Wheeler started a thread on [our mailing list](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/listinfo/rb-general) enquiring on the [status of core reproducibility in Debian](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-October/001215.html).

* It was [announced](https://twitter.com/SFScon/status/1055071106552475648) that Chris Lamb will be presenting in on Reproducible Builds at the [SFScon](https://www.sfscon.it) conference in Bozen, Italy on [reproducible builds and how they can prevent developers from becoming targets of various attacks](https://www.sfscon.it/talks/you-think-youre-not-a-target-a-tale-of-three-developers/). In addition, Arnout Engelen and Jelle van der Waa will present at [HackerHotel](https://hackerhotel.nl/) in mid-February 2019 on ["Improving Open Source Security with Reproducible Builds"](https://hackerhotel.nl/index.php/lectures/).

* The [CMake](https://cmake.org) build system documented a new [`BUILD_RPATH_USE_ORIGIN`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/git-master/prop_tgt/BUILD_RPATH_USE_ORIGIN.html) flag that determines whether to use (typically unreproducible) absolute build paths versus relative ones in the [`rpath`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rpath) library search path header found in executables on UNIX systems.

* Chris Lamb added a [Salsa ribbon](https://lamby.pages.debian.net/salsa-ribbons/) to the [diffoscope.org](https://diffoscope.org/) website. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope-website/commit/114e8ef)]

* Bernhard M. Wiedemann gave an [update on the openSUSE reproducible builds status](https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2018-10/msg00242.html), including details on remaining issues with 57 important packages.

* Jelle van der Waa [held an IRC meeting](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-October/001213.html) on 23th of October.

* 44 Debian package reviews were added, 6 were updated and 15 were removed in this week, adding to [our knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html).

This week's edition was written by Bernhard M. Wiedemann, Chris Lamb, Holger Levsen, Jelle van der Waa, Marina Moore, Vagrant Cascadian & reviewed by a bunch of Reproducible Builds folks on IRC & the mailing lists.
