What happened in the [Reproducible
Builds](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds) effort between June 12th and June 18th 2016:

Media coverage
--------------

* Sune Vuorela blogged about [making Qt documentation reproducible](http://pusling.com/blog/?p=410) while spending good times in the Alps.

GSoC and Outreachy updates
--------------------------

Weekly reports by our participants:

- [Scarlett Clark](http://scarlettgatelyclark.com/2016/debian-kde-reproducible-builds-week-3-randa-platforms-equals-busy-times/)
- [Satyam Zode](https://satyamz.github.io/blog/2016/06/13/gsoc-2016-week-2-and-3-reproducible-builds-in-debian/)

Toolchain fixes
---------------

- [texlive-bin](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/texlive-bin)/2016.20160513.41080-3 has been uploaded to unstable,
  featuring support for `FORCE_SOURCE_DATE`.  See the <a href="posts/59#FORCE_SOURCE_DATE">last post</a>
  for details on it.
- [doxygen](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/doxygen)/1.4.4-1 has been uploaded to unstable, fixing [#822197](https://bugs.debian.org/822197)
  ([upstream bug](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/2534)), which caused
  some generated html file to contain unreproducible memory addresses of Python
  objects used at build time.
- [debhelper](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/debhelper)/9.20160618 has been uploaded to unstable, fixing [#824490](https://bugs.debian.org/824490),
  which instructs `ant` to not save the username of the build user in the
  generated files.  Original patch by Emmanuel Bourg.
- HW42 reported [a long-known (although only internally) bug in our
  dpkg-buildinfo](https://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/reproducible-builds/Week-of-Mon-20160613/005789.html).
  this particular bug doesn't affect our current infrastructure, but it's a
  blocker for having .buildinfo support merged upstream.
- [epydoc](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/epydoc)/3.0.1+dfsg-13 and 3.0.1+dfsg-14 have been uploaded by Kenneth J.
  Pronovici which fixes nondeterministic ordering issues in generated
  documentation and removes memory addresses. Original patches ([#825968](https://bugs.debian.org/825968)
  and [#827416](https://bugs.debian.org/827416)) by Sascha Steinbiss.

With this upload of `texlive-bin` we decided to stop keeping our patched fork of
as most of the patches for `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` support had been integrated
upstream already, and the last one (making `FORCE_SOURCE_DATE` default to `1`)
had been refused.  So, we are now going to let the archive be rebuilt against
unstable's `texlive-bin` and see how many packages will become unreproducible
with this change; once enough data will be collected we will ponder whether
`FORCE_SOURCE_DATE` should be exported by helper tools (such as debhelper) or
manually exported by every package that needs it.

(For those wondering: we still recommend to follow `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` always
and don't recommend other projects to implement `FORCE_SOURCE_DATE`…)

With the drop of `texlive-bin` we now have only **three** [modified packages in our
experimental repository](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_repositories.html).

Reproducible work in other projects
-----------------------------------

- Ed Maste [sent a patch](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D6829) to have
  ELF Tool Chain's elfcopy support `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`.
- Ed Maste [changed](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&revision=301974)
  FreeBSD's `ar(1)` to have a reproducible output by default when invoked with `-s`.
- Ed Maste [merged changes](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/changeset/base/301879)
  from NetBSD's makefs to FreeBSD's to add a command line option for setting the
  timestamp.
- Ed Maste [reported on FreeBSD package reproducibility details](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-ports/2016-June/103584.html)
  from the investigation for his
  [BSDCan talk](https://www.bsdcan.org/2016/schedule/events/714.en.html),
  including
  [diffoscope results](https://people.freebsd.org/~emaste/reproducible-builds/iteration-1/diffoscope/)
  for the non-reproducible packages.
- Holger Levsen spent some time thinking and [documenting how to store package notes](https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/reproducible/notes.git/tree/README?h=multi-project-syntax)
  and issues in a multi-distribution friendly manner, so that we can share
  these issues and notes between reproducible efforts across different projects.
  [Thoughts we had about this topic](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/athens2015/issue-database/)
  during the Athens meeting last December are included in the updated README.

Package reviews
---------------

36 reviews have been added, 12 have been updated and 31 have been removed in this week.

17 FTBFS bugs have been reported by Chris Lamb, Santiago Vila and Dominic Hargreaves.


diffoscope development
----------------------

Satyam worked on argument completion ([#826711](https://bugs.debian.org/826711)) for diffoscope.

strip-nondeterminism development
--------------------------------

Mattia Rizzolo uploaded [strip-nondeterminism](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/strip-nondeterminism) 0.019-1~bpo8+1 to
jessie-backports.

reprotest development
---------------------

Ceridwen filed an Intent To Package (ITP) bug for reprotest as [#827293](https://bugs.debian.org/827293).

tests.reproducible-builds.org
-----------------------

- Mattia Rizzolo uploaded [pbuilder](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/pbuilder) 0.225 to unstable, providing built-in
  support for eatmydata.  We're planning to use it in armhf and i386 builders
  where we don't build in tmpfs, to increase the build speed some more.
- Valery Young reworked the appearance of the package page, hopefully making them more
  intuitive and usable.  In the process she changed the script generating them
  to use [a real templating system](https://mustache.github.io/), thus improving
  maintenance for the future.
- Holger adjusted the scheduler to reschedule packages in state 'depwait' after
  two days instead of three.
- Mattia added the bug title next to the bug numbers in the notes.

Misc.
-----

This week's edition was written by Mattia Rizzolo, Reiner Herrmann, Ed Maste and Holger Levsen and reviewed by a bunch of Reproducible builds folks on IRC.
