Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday July 23 and Saturday July 29 2017:

* Mattia posted an [extensive status update from the Debian Reproducible Builds project](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2017/07/msg00004.html) to the `debian-devel-announce` mailing list. There were subsequent discussions on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14834386) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/6p14q0/debians_archive_is_up_to_94_for_reproducible_build/).

* A NASA presentation on "[Real system failures](https://c3.nasa.gov/dashlink/resources/624/)" contained [an interesting slide pertaining to reproducible builds](https://c3.nasa.gov/dashlink/static/media/other/ObservedFailures54.html).

* A 2015 article on Reproducible Builds ("[How Debian Is Trying to Shut Down the CIA and Make Software Trustworthy Again](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/78xnge/how-debian-is-trying-to-shut-down-the-cia-and-make-software-trustworthy-again)") resurfaced in popularity, possibly due to the recent Wikileaks "[Vault 7](https://wikileaks.org/vault7/)" exposure of malware whose effects can be ameliorated or detected by adopting Reproducible Builds.

Toolchain development and fixes
-------------------------------

* Chris Lamb sent an experimental patch to `apt` to make the output of `apt-ftparchive` reproducible. Thanks to David Kalnischkies for reworking the result. ([#869557](https://bugs.debian.org/869557))
