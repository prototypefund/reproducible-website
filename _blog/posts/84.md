  - [Output coloured diff using colordiff(1) via --text-color={never,auto,always}](https://anonscm.debian.org/git/reproducible/diffoscope.git/commit/?id=266878a)

Is is available now in Debian, Archlinux and on [PyPI](https://pypi.org).

- At the Reproducible Builds Boston hackathon Anders Kaseorg filed [#846895](https://bugs.debian.org/846895) treat `.par` files as Zip archives, including a patch which was merged into `master`.

reprotest development
---------------------

- reprotest 0.4 was uploaded to unstable by Ximin Luo:

  - [disorderfs variation: don't query the testbed, put that in the script instead](https://anonscm.debian.org/git/reproducible/reprotest.git/commit/?id=1c3ab06)
  - [Add a build\_path\_same variation to run builds from the same path](https://anonscm.debian.org/git/reproducible/reprotest.git/commit/?id=3d36071)
  - [Fix auto-presets in the case of a file in the current directory](https://anonscm.debian.org/git/reproducible/reprotest.git/commit/?id=0aa71d0)
  - [Fix d/control so reprotesting reprotest in sbuild works (6 reproductions)](https://anonscm.debian.org/git/reproducible/reprotest.git/commit/?id=9027eb2)
  - [Add util-linux to Recommends since we use it to vary some things](https://anonscm.debian.org/git/reproducible/reprotest.git/commit/?id=af6a616)


tests.reproducible-builds.org
-----------------------

- Holger made a couple of changes:

  - Group all "done" and all "open" usertagged bugs together in the [bugs graphs](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_bugs.html) and move the "done bugs" from the bottom of these gaps.
  - Update list of packages installed on `.debian.org` machines.
  - Made the maintenance jobs run every 2h instead of 3h.
  - Various bug fixes and minor improvements.

- After thorough review by Mattia, some patches by Valerie were merged in preparation of the switch from sqlite to Postgresql, most notably a conversion to the sqlalchemy expression language.

- Holger [gave a talk at Profitbricks](https://jenkins.debian.net/userContent/presentations/2016-11-30-Profitbricks/#/) about how Debian is using 168 cores, 503 GB RAM and 5 TB storage to make `jenkins.debian.net` and `tests.reproducible-builds.org` run. Many thanks to Profitbricks for supporting `jenkins.debian.net` since August 2012!

- Holger created a Jenkins job to build [reprotest](https://jenkins.debian.net/job/reproducible_reprotest_from_git_master/) from git master branch.
  
- Finally, the Jenkins [Naginator](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Naginator+Plugin) plugin was installed to retry git cloning in case of [Alioth](https://wiki.debian.org/Alioth)/network failures, this will benefit all jobs using Git on `jenkins.debian.net`.

Misc.
-----

This week's edition was written by Chris Lamb, Valerie Young, Vagrant Cascadian, Holger Levsen and reviewed by a bunch of Reproducible Builds folks on IRC.
