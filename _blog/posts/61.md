What happened in the [Reproducible
Builds](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds) effort between June 19th and
June 25th 2016.

Media coverage
--------------

- Holger Levsen [gave a talk at openSUSE Conference 2016](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC16/program/proposal/996) explaining the general idea and status of Reproducible Builds. This talk is available as [video recording](https://cdn.media.ccc.de/events/osc/2016/h264-hd/osc16-996-eng-Reproducible_builds_everywhere_and_beyond_hd.mp4).

- This was followed by Bernhard Wiedemannn, detailing his work on [Reproducible Builds for openSUSE](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC16/program/proposal/838) which is also available as [video recording](https://cdn.media.ccc.de/events/osc/2016/h264-hd/osc16-984-eng-openSUSE_and_SUSE_Linux_Enterprise_hd.mp4):
  - openSUSE uses SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH now too
  - How to create bit-for-bit identical RPMs
  - How strip-nondeterminism is Python and thus unsuitable for the openSUSE base system

- [Mozilla awarded $77k](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2016/06/22/mozilla-awards-385000-to-open-source-projects-as-part-of-moss-mission-partners-program/) to work on [reproducible builds for Tails](https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/reproducible_builds/).
  The goal is to enable anyone (given sufficient technical skills and
  hardware resources) to rebuild from source a given Tails release, in
  order to independently verify that it matches the ISO image that
  was published. A substantial part of this work will be done in Debian:
  for example, to make the side-effects of some packages'
  post-installation scripts deterministic. On the longer term, this
  work should benefit other projects that want to make their own
  builds reproducible (e.g. operating system images for the cloud and
  embedded systems, operating system installation media, other Live
  systems).

GSoC and Outreachy updates
--------------------------

- Valerie Young [published a report](http://www.spectranaut.cc/?p=31) detailing what
  she did the <a href="/posts/60">last week</a> regarding improving [tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/).
- Ceridwen announced reprotest's arrival in the NEW queue and [discussed](https://reproducible.alioth.debian.org/blog/posts/people/ceridwen/reprotest_week4/) autopkgtest's layout.


Toolchain fixes
---------------

 * Anton Gladky uploaded an NMU of [python-setuptools](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/python-setuptools), which sorts entries in `native_libs.txt` files ([#825857](https://bugs.debian.org/825857)).

Other upstream fixes
--------------------

Emil Velikov searched on IRC for hints on how to guarantee unique values during
build [to invalidate](https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/2016-May/118554.html)
shader caches in Mesa, when also no
[VCS information](https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/2016-June/120709.html)
is available.  A possible solution is a timestamp, which is unique enough for
local builds, but can still be reproducible by allowing it to be overwritten
with `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`.

Packages fixed
--------------

The following 9 packages have become reproducible due to changes in their
build dependencies:

diffoscope development
----------------------

 - Satyam Zode [added argument completion](https://bugs.debian.org/826711).
 - [Chris Lamb](https://chris-lamb.co.uk) made the confusing ["No differences found inside, yet data differs"](https://bugs.debian.org/827981) message less confusing.

Quote of the week
-----------------

"My builds are so reproducible, they fail exactly every second time."

Misc.
-----

This week's edition was written by Chris Lamb (lamby), Reiner Herrmann and Holger Levsen and reviewed by a bunch of Reproducible builds folks on IRC.
