Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday May 6 and Saturday May 12 2018:

* [Ricardo Wurmus](http://bioinformatics.mdc-berlin.de/team.html#ricardo-wurmus) published a paper titled [Reproducible bioinformatics pipelines with Guix](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/blog/2018/paper-on-reproducible-bioinformatics-pipelines-with-guix/) which leverages [GNU Guix](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/) and reproducible builds in general as "a crucial foundation for computational experiments".

* There will be two talks at the upcoming [MiniDebConfHamburg](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEvents/de/2018/MiniDebConfHamburg) regarding Reproducible Builds which are detailed on the [event's schedule](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEvents/de/2018/MiniDebConfHamburg#Schedule).

* *kpcyrd* investigated and filed an issue against the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language regarding the [non-deterministic use of `cmpq`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/50556) which is resulting in non-determinstic binaries.

* There was further discussion on our mailing list regarding [the typeface and colour scheme, etc.](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-May/000923.html) of our logo.

* 22 package reviews updated and 36 have been removed in this week, adding to our [knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html).
