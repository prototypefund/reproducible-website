Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday October 15 and Saturday October 21 2017:

* The [Tails](tails.boum.org) project published a [report on how they made their ISO images reproducible](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2017-October/000656.html).

* [dpkg](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/dpkg) 1.19.0 was uploaded, including support for:

    * A new `Build-Kernel-Version` field in `.buildinfo` files that can be generated with a new `dpkg-genbuildinfo --always-include-kernel` option. ([#873937](https://bugs.debian.org/873937))
