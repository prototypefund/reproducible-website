Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday June 17 and Saturday June 23 2018:

* The [*Toward a fully reproducible Debian*](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/757118/f2f894279576c348/) LWN article linked in last week's blog was mentioned and discussed on many different forums including [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17353371), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/8sij70/toward_a_fully_reproducible_debian/) and [LWN itself](https://lwn.net/Articles/757118/#Comments).

* Torsten Grote [started a discussion on our mailing list regarding reproducible Android apps](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-June/001027.html), filing [an issue on Google's issue tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/110237303).

* Jeremie Dimino also [asked a question about deterministic compilation with OCaml](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-June/001046.html) and there was further movement on [OCaml's support for reproducible builds](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/1515#issuecomment-398517360) in their issue tracker.

* Sylvain Beucler [updated our website to clarify `-fdebug-prefix-map`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/1dc67c2) and similar.

* 8 package reviews were added, 65 have been updated and 45 have been removed in this week, adding to our [knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html). In addition, two issue types were been removed ([max\_output\_size\_reached](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/f0c76fa3) & [ftbfs\_in\_jenkins\_setup\_due\_to\_socket\_binding](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/fd229d4))

* The next next reproducible builds IRC meeting has been scheduled for [Tuesday the 17th of July at 16:00 UTC](http://time.is/compare/1600_17_Jul_2018_in_UTC) and [an agenda is being collected](https://pad.riseup.net/p/reproducible-irc-meeting-13).

tests.reproducible-builds.org development
-----------------------------------------

There were a large number of changes to our [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)-based testing framework that powers [tests.reproducible-builds.org](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/), including:

* Chris Lamb:
    * [Correct "which build timed out" grammar](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/30a24438).

* Mattia Rizzolo:
    * [Introduce a new "timeout" status to represent build timeouts](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/4395f641), requiring multiple changes including [applying the timeout directly to diffoscope](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/a903dd7b), adding a [new icon to the HTML dashboard](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/49799666), [differentiating the IRC messages](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/bae726d3), [listing packages on the issues page](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/f6dfd246) and multiple other fixups.
    * Don't install [Lintian][https://lintian.debian.org] on our hosts. ([commit](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/6f915a55))
    * Use [APT pinning](https://wiki.debian.org/AptPreferences) instead of [using `apt-get install -t`](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/67fb58ea).
    * [Error out when `psql` fails](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/3cb06dd7).
    * Move the "automatic artifacts" notifications [back to the `#debian-devel-changes` IRC channel](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/0b123b98).
    * Perform [SQL `UPSERT` operation](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/UPSERT) instead of [manually checking for presence before UPDATE/INSERT](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/34570a21).
    * [Reschedule stale builds, instead of dropping them](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/99cdf49a).
    * [Rename the `404` status to `E404` to make a future change easier](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/ca3416d7).
