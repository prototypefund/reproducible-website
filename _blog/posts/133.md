Here's what happened in the [Reproducible
Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday November 5 and
Saturday November 11 2017:


Upcoming events
---------------

On November 17th Chris Lamb will present at [Open Compliance
Summit](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-compliance-summit/),
Yokohama, Japan on how reproducible builds ensures the long-term sustainability
of technology infrastructure.

We plan to hold [an assembly at
34C3](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/wiki/index.php/Assembly:Reproducible-Builds)
- hope to see you there!


LEDE CI tests
-------------

Thanks to the work of lynxis, Mattia and h01ger, we're now testing all LEDE
packages in our setup. This is our [first result for the ar71xx
target](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/lede/lede_ar71xx.html): "502
(100.0%) out of 502 built images and 4932 (94.8%) out of 5200 built packages
were reproducible in our test setup." - see below for details how this was
achieved.


Bootstrapping and Diverse Double Compilation
--------------------------------------------

As a follow-up of a [discussion on bootstrapping compilers we had on the Berlin
summit](https://pad.riseup.net/p/reproduciblebuildsIII-crossdistro), Bernhard
and Ximin worked on a Proof of Concept for Diverse Double Compilation of tinycc
(aka tcc).

Ximin Luo did a successful [diverse-double compilation of
tinycc](https://github.com/bmwiedemann/ddcpoc/) git HEAD using gcc-7.2.0,
clang-4.0.1, icc-18.0.0 and pgcc-17.10-0 (pgcc needs to triple-compile it).
More variations are planned for the future, with the eventual aim to reproduce
the same binaries cross-distro, and extend it to test GCC itself.
