Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday August 26 and Saturday September 1 2018:

* Bernhard M. Wiedemann wrote an article on the [SUSE Blog](https://www.suse.com/c/blog/) entitled "[Extending trust in our binaries: No backdoors have been found](https://www.suse.com/c/extending-trust-in-our-binaries-no-backdoors-have-been-found/)" on the current status of reproducible builds in SUSE.

* [Mes](https://gitlab.com/janneke/mes) (a Scheme-based compiler for our "sister" [bootstrappable builds](http://bootstrappable.org) effort) [announced their 0.17 release and them becoming a GNU project](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=GNU-Mes-0.17-Released)

* [Jelle van der Waa](https://vdwaa.nl/) discussed the [removal of `svn $Id$` substitutions](https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2018-August/029355.html) in [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) to make builds reproducible.

* Chris Lamb uploaded version `100` of [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org) (our in-depth "diff-on-steroids" utility which helps us diagnose reproducibility issues in packages) was [uploaded to Debian unstable, closing 8 bugs](https://tracker.debian.org/news/984157/accepted-diffoscope-100-source-all-into-unstable/).

* There were further updates for [our website](https://reproducible-builds.org/) including Arnout Engelen [adding Maven and the sbt build tool](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/3d776c8) projects and introducing a [link from the footer to sections in 'who'](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/6ed4948). Chris Lamb also added [Jelle van der Waa](https://vdwaa.nl/) talk to our [resources](https://reproducible-builds.org/resources/) page [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/140bca8)], added [Monero](https://getmonero.org/>) to the [Who is Involved?](https://reproducible-builds.org/who/) page and added the relevant [DebConf 18](http://debconf18.debconf.org/) presentations to our database [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/608b904>)].

* 6 Debian package reviews were added, 7 were updated and 9 were removed in this week by Chris Lamb, adding to [our knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html).
