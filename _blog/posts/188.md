* Holger Levsen increased the partition holding /var/lib/jenkins/userContent/reproducible on jenkins.d.n from 255G to 400G, thanks to Profitbricks for sponsoring this virtual hardware for more than 6 years now. This was needed for deploying 1c1e7a274b resulting in nice new json diff being visible like https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/dbdjson/buster/arm64/continuity_0.0~git20180216.d8fb858-1.diffoscope.json.gz

* Holger Levsen and Jelle van der Waa have started to add integrate new Arch Linux build nodes, repro1.pkgbuild.com and repro2.pkgbuild.com, running Arch Linux, into the jenkins.debian.net build setup. Thanks to FIXME for donating these systems to us!
