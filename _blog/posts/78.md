What happened in the [Reproducible
Builds](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds) effort between Sunday October 16 and Saturday October 22 2016:

Media coverage
--------------

- Chris Lamb presented at [Software Freedom Kosovo](http://sfk.flossk.org/sfk16/) on reproducible builds on Saturday 22nd October.

Upcoming events
---------------

- JÃ¼rgen Rose will be giving a talk on [Enforcing reproducible builds with Eclipse Package Drone](https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2016/session/enforcing-reproducible-builds-eclipse-package-drone) at EclipseCon Europe 2016 in Ludwigsburg, Germany on October 27th.

buildinfo.debian.net
--------------------

In order to build packages reproducibly, you not only need identical sources but also some external definition of the environment used for a particular build. This definition includes the inputs and the outputs and, in the Debian case, are available in a ``$package_$architecture_$version.buildinfo`` file.

We anticipate the next ``dpkg`` upload to sid will create ``.buildinfo`` files by default. Whilst it's clear that we also need to teach dak to deal with them ([#763822](https://bugs.debian.org/763822)) its not actually clear how to handle ``.buildinfo`` files after ``dak`` has processed them and how to make them available to the world.

To this end, Chris Lamb has started development on a [proof-of-concept ``.buildinfo`` server](https://buildinfo.debian.net/) to see what issues arise. [Source](https://github.com/lamby/buildinfo.debian.net)


Reproducible work in other projects
-----------------------------------

- Ximin Luo submitted a [patch to GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2016-10/msg01338.html) as a prerequisite for future patches to make debugging symbols reproducible.

Misc.

Our [poll to find a good time for an IRC meeting](https://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/reproducible-builds/Week-of-Mon-20161017/007298.html) is still running until Tuesday, October 25st; please reply as soon as possible.

We need a logo! Some [ideas and requirements for a Reproducible Builds logo](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/Logo) have been documented in the wiki. Contributions very welcome, even if simply by forwarding this information.

This week's edition was written by Chris Lamb & Holger Levsen and reviewed by a bunch of Reproducible Builds folks on IRC.
