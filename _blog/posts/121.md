Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday August 13 and Saturday August 19 2017:

Reproducible Builds finally mandated by Debian Policy
-----------------------------------------------------

"Packages should build reproducibly" [was merged into Debian
policy](https://anonscm.debian.org/git/dbnpolicy/policy.git/commit/?id=bf256860fbf9d7dccc05fe1aa85841b7a1b1d712)! The added text is as follows and
has been [included into debian-policy 4.1.0.0](https://tracker.debian.org/news/864773):

<pre>
Reproducibility
---------------

Packages should build reproducibly, which for the purposes of this
document [#]_ means that given

- a version of a source package unpacked at a given path;
- a set of versions of installed build dependencies;
- a set of environment variable values;
- a build architecture; and
- a host architecture,

repeatedly building the source package for the build architecture on
any machine of the host architecture with those versions of the build
dependencies installed and exactly those environment variable values
set will produce bit-for-bit identical binary packages.

It is recommended that packages produce bit-for-bit identical binaries
even if most environment variables and build paths are varied.  It is
intended for this stricter standard to replace the above when it is
easier for packages to meet it.

.. [#]
   This is Debian's precisification of the `reproducible-builds.org
   definition <https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/definition/>`_.

* Holger Levsen [wrote a blog post](https://layer-acht.org/thinking/blog/20170812-reproducible-policy/)
  briefly describing the background and implications of this. To quote him: "we are *not 94% done* yet, rather more like half done or so. We still need tools and processes to *enable anyone to indepently verify* that a given binary comes from the sources it is said to be coming, this will involve distributing `.buildinfo` files and providing user interfaces in APT and elsewhere and probably also systematic rebuilds by us and other parties. And 6% or 7% of the archive is still a lot of packages, eg. in Buster we currently still have [273 unreproducible key packages](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/buster/amd64/pkg_set_key_packages.html) and for a large part we don't have patches yet so there is still a lot of work ahead."
* There were discussion threads on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15010438)
  and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/6touxc/new_debian_policy_packages_should_be_reproducible/).
* Our long-term goal is that Policy mandates that packages "must" be reproducible, but for that we need to show further progress and also reach a consensus on `.buildinfo` files and much more.

Reproducible work in other projects
-----------------------------------

Bernhard M. Wiedemann's [reproducibleopensuse
scripts](https://github.com/bmwiedemann/reproducibleopensuse) now
[work on Debian buster](https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-build/pull/376) on the
openSUSE Build Service with the latest versions of
[osc](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:OSC) and
[obs-build](https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-build).


Toolchain development and fixes
-------------------------------

<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/872514">#872514</a> was opened on <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/devscripts">devscripts</a> by Chris Lamb to add a
`reproducible-check` program to report on the reproducibility status of
installed packages.

Misc.
-----

This week's edition was written by Ximin Luo, Chris Lamb and Holger Levsen & reviewed by a bunch
of Reproducible Builds folks on IRC & the mailing lists.
