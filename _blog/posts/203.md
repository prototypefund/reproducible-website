* Chris Lamb [migrated the canonical list of strip-nondeterminism issues to salsa](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/strip-nondeterminism/issues)

* A [proposed toolchain patch](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/12341) for [Python's distutils](https://docs.python.org/3/library/distutils.html) module to sort the list of sources would make builds of many Python modules with binary components more reproducible.
