What happened in the [Reproducible
Builds](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds) effort between April 24th and 30th 2016.

Media coverage
--------------

Reproducible builds were mentioned explicitly in two talks at the [Mini-DebConf in Vienna](http://debienna.at/minidebconf_vie2016/):

 * Martin Michlmayr had a talk in which he presented an overview about [innovations and changes in Debian in the last years](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2016/mini-debconf-vienna/webm/Innovations_in_the_Debian_project.webm). Martin expressed his disappointment that there was no talk from us in Vienna (we'll fix this at DebConf16 in Cape Town) and described the reproducible builds work as "a real innovation". His talk is very much worth seeing, whatever your current perspective, it might change your view on Debian.
 * Ben Hutchings explains how [Secure Boot](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2016/mini-debconf-vienna/webm/Secure_Boot_vs_the_Debian_linux_package.webm) will use signed kernels via separate signature packages and how this was designed with reproducible builds in mind.

Aspiration together with the OTF CommunityLab released [their report](https://reproducible-builds.org/files/AspirationOTFCommunityLabReproducibleBuildsSummitReport.pdf) about the [Reproducible Builds summit in December 2015 in Athens](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/athens2015/).

Toolchain fixes
---------------

Now that the GCC development window has been opened again, the *SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH* patch by Dhole and Matthias Klose to address the issue [timestamps_from_cpp_macros](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/issues/unstable/timestamps_from_cpp_macros_issue.html) (`__DATE__` / `__TIME__`) has been [applied upstream](https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commitdiff;h=e3e8c48c4a494d9da741c1c8ea6c4c0b7c4ff934) and will be released with GCC 7.

Following that Matthias Klose also has uploaded [gcc-5](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/gcc-5)/5.3.1-17 and [gcc-6](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/gcc-6)/6.1.1-1 to unstable with a backport of that *SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH* patch.

Emmanuel Bourg uploaded [maven](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/maven)/3.3.9-4, which uses *SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH* for the `maven.build.timestamp`.

([SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH specification](https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/))

Other upstream changes
----------------------

Alexis Bienvenüe [submitted a patch](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/2503) to Sphinx which extends *SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH* support for copyright years in generated documentation.

strip-nondeterminism development
--------------------------------

-----------------------

 * To [monitor the uptodateness of diffoscope everywhere](https://jenkins.debian.net/view/reproducible/view/diffoscope/), tests checking this on FreeBSD, NetBSD & MacPorts were added. Tests on other distributions will be added once the relevant bugs in [whohas](https://tracker.debian.org/whohas) are fixed in jessie. (h01ger)

Misc.
-----

Amongst the [29 interns who will work on Debian through GSoC and Outreachy](https://bits.debian.org/2016/04/welcome-summer-interns-2016.html) there are four who will be contributing to Reproducible Builds for Debian and Free Software. We are very glad to welcome ceridwen, Satyam Zode, Scarlett Clark and Valerie Young and look forward to working together with them the coming months (and maybe beyond)!
 

This week's edition was written by Reiner Herrmann and Holger Levsen and reviewed by a bunch of Reproducible builds folks on IRC.
