Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds) effort between Sunday January 22 and Saturday January 28 2017:


Media coverage

Upcoming Events

- "Verifying Software Freedom with Reproducible Builds" will be presented by Vagrant Cascadian at [Libreplanet2017](https://www.libreplanet.org/2017/) in Boston, March 25th-26th.


Reproducible work in other projects
-----------------------------------

John Gilmore [wrote an interesting mail about how Cygnus.com worked on reproducible builds in the early 1990s](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2017-January/000309.html). It's eye opening to see how the dealt with basically the very same problems we're dealing with today, how they solved them and then to realize that most of this has been forgotten and bit-rotted in the last 20 years. How will we prevent history repeating itself here?


Toolchain development and fixes
-------------------------------

Christoph Biedl [wrote a mail describing an interesting problem in to the way binNMUs are done in Debian](https://lists.debian.org/msgid-search/1485611066@msgid.manchmal.in-ulm.de).

Guillem Jover made a number of changes to ``dpkg`` that affect the Reproducible Builds effort within Debian:

- Always set ``SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`` in ``dpkg-buildpackage`` and ``dpkg-source``. Use the current date if the changelog does not have one. Closes: [#849081](https://bugs.debian.org/849081)

- Add initial support for ``DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS`` to ``dpkg-genbuildinfo``. This will make it possible to enable or disable specific features that should be recorded in the ``.buildinfo`` file. For now only “all” and “path” are supported. Closes: [#848705](https://bugs.debian.org/848705)

- Include ``.buildinfo`` files also for source-only uploads in ``dpkg-genchanges``. Closes: [#846164](https://bugs.debian.org/846164)

- Add support for signed ``.buildinfo`` files to ``dpkg-buildpackage``. Add new ``-ui`` and ``--unsigned-buildinfo`` options. Closes: [#843925](https://bugs.debian.org/843925)

- Make ``dpkg-buildpackage --unsigned-changes`` not sign ``.buildinfo`` either. This breaks the expectations of users and tools, because there was no way previously to request no signing at all. Closes: [#852822](https://bugs.debian.org/852822)


Packages reviewed and fixed, and bugs filed
-------------------------------------------

Chris Lamb:

* [#852482](https://bugs.debian.org/852482) filed against [flask-limiter](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/flask-limiter).

tests.reproducible-builds.org
-----------------------

- h01ger experimented with reusing SSH control connections but stopped that experiment when we ran into more network issues than before. To be continued, as we're having 10k SSH connections per day and saving 2 seconds each time would sum up, especially on the Jenkins host itself.
- h01ger made the scheduler run 3 times a day, 2.5h after dinstall runs, instead of every 3h as before.
- h01ger restructured the [https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_breakages.html](breakages page) and improved the corresponding Jenins job.
- h01ger also unblacklisted [xmds2](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/xmds2), [sofia-sip](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/sofia-sip) and [ck](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ck) - if you think other packages should be unblacklisted (maybe only on some architectures), please do tell us.

Misc.
-----

This week's edition was written by Chris Lamb and Holger Levsen & reviewed by a bunch of Reproducible Builds folks on IRC & the mailing lists.
