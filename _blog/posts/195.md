Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday January 13th and Saturday January 19th 2019:

* In the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language community there was an interesting discussion on the [/r/rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust) subreddit around [the ripgrep utility becoming reproducible in Debian](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/afscgo/ripgrep_0100_is_reproducible_in_debian/). In addition, [Tony Arcieri](https://tonyarcieri.com/) opened a issue in the Rust's [Secure Code Working Group](https://twitter.com/rustsecurecode) enquiring about [reproducible builds tooling](https://github.com/rust-secure-code/wg/issues/28).

* Last week, Chris Lamb opened Debian bug [#919207](https://bugs.debian.org/919207) requesting that the [`squashfs-tools`](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/squashfs-tools) package (which creates and manipulates read-only compressed file systems) applies a patch to remove non-deterministic data introduced by a "fragmentation deflator" thread. This was the final patch required for reproducible images for (at least) [Tails](https://tails.boum.org).

    Whilst Laszlo Boszormenyi applied the patch, he [subsequently reverted the change](https://bugs.debian.org/919207#15) as it was breaking [LZO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Oberhumer) compression. However, Chris subsequently [updated and fixed the issue](https://bugs.debian.org/919207#24) which was then uploaded in version [`1:4.3-11`](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1022501/accepted-squashfs-tools-143-11-source-into-unstable/).

* As part of the [Debian Long Term Support (LTS)](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS) effort it was [noticed that an old package was failing to build beyond ~2015](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/2019/01/msg00033.html).

* Holger Levsen released and uploaded `disorderfs` (our [FUSE](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse)-based filesystem that deliberately introduces non-determinism into filesystems) version `0.5.6-1` to Debian unstable [[...](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1021833/accepted-disorderfs-056-1-source-into-unstable/)] and Chris Lamb released/uploaded `strip-nondeterminism` (our tool that post-processes files to remove known non-deterministic output) version `1.1.0-1` to Debian unstable [[...](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1020523/accepted-strip-nondeterminism-110-1-source-all-into-unstable/)] too.

* Chris Lamb added 8 Debian package reviews but 12 were also updated and 14 were removed in this week, adding to [our knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html).

* There were a number of interesting discussions on [our mailing list](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/) this week including:
    * Hervé Boutemy posted [a brief introduction to "reproducible-central"](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2019-January/001408.html) after a number of discussions and documentation regarding [Java Virtual Machine rebuilder attestations](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/jvm/) and the [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) build tool.
    * Elio Qoshi from [Ura Design](https://ura.design/) asking [whether we would be interested](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2019-January/001412.html) in updating [our style guide]({{ "/style-epoch/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
    * Lastly, Eli Schwartz posted an update regarding [reproducible package archives](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2019-January/001402.html) in [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/).

## Packages reviewed and fixed, and bugs filed

* Bernhard M. Wiedemann:
    * [python-cmarkgfm](https://github.com/theacodes/cmarkgfm/pull/17) (merged, sort python glob)
* Chris Lamb:
    * [#919566](https://bugs.debian.org/919566) filed against [satpy](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/satpy) ([forwarded upstream](https://github.com/pytroll/satpy/pull/579)).

## [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/) development

[diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/) is our in-depth "diff-on-steroids" utility which helps us diagnose reproducibility issues in packages. There was a few updates this week including contributions from:

* Chris Lamb:
    * Fix inverted logic and invalid reference to `file` in the [FreePascal](https://www.freepascal.org/) comparator. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/248e9ba)]
    * Use [`str.format`](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/stdtypes.html#str.format) over `+` for string concatenation. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/7bf992b)]
    * Re-enable [Gnumeric](http://www.gnumeric.org/) `Build-Depends`. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/b696748)] [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/commit/12882be)]

* Jelle van der Waa:
    * Remove an unused `re` import in the [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) comparator. ([MR: !18](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/merge_requests/18))

Version `108` was then [uploaded to Debian unstable](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1020530/accepted-diffoscope-108-source-all-into-unstable/) by Chris Lamb and was subsequently [backported to the `stretch-backports` distribution](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1021754/accepted-diffoscope-108bpo91-source-all-into-stretch-backports/) by Mattia Rizzolo.

## Website development

There were a number of updates to the [reproducible-builds.org](https://reproducible-builds.org) project website this week, including:

* Hervé Boutemy:
    * Large number of changes to the [Java Virtual Machine]({{ "/docs/jvm/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) page including adding the `build-root` property for multi-module builds [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/bfd1421)], adding instructions on [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) rebuild arguments [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/190ca8b)], amongst many others [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/4a7e0fe)] [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/928c71f)] [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/12a8023)].
* Holger Levsen:
    * Drop [LEDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEDE) as the project has re-merged with [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/). [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/4257259)]
* Peter Wu:
    * Mention `QT_RCC_SOURCE_DATE_OVERRIDE` and add some more CMake, RPATH and Qt notes on the [deterministic build systems]({{ "/docs/deterministic-build-systems/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) page. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/36bca83)] [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/83d4700)] [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/77d689d)].
    * Document the use of `-fmacro-prefix-map` and `-ffile-prefix-map` on the [build path]({{ "/docs/build-path/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) page. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/edca632)]
    * Fix some links and typos on the [contribute]({{ "/contribute/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) page, some dead links to [Salsa](https://salsa.debian.org) and correct some link formatting issues. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/61fd247)] [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/56d3c75)] [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-website/commit/821d532)]

## Test framework development

We operate a comprehensive [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)-based testing framework that powers [tests.reproducible-builds.org](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org). This week:

* [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) is the first project being built on nodes decidated from [OSUOSL](https://osuosl.org/).

   Interestingly, these new nodes are running `4.19` Linux kernels from the `stretch-backports` distribution as [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) in Arch needs a newer kernel than the kernel in Debian stretch to build. As a result of this we are now seeing 1,736 builds of Arch packages in the last 24h, meaning our subset of packages are being fully rebuilt every 5 or 6 days.

* [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) becomes the second project to be tested on these new nodes after Holger Levsen increased the size of various partitions to accommodate the builds, as well as to provide a [Squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/) proxy for all our OSUOSL nodes.

The following more-specific changes were made:

* Eli Schwartz:
    * Import Arch Linux [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/) keys before running [`makepkg`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/makepkg). [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/1b36569b)]
    * Perform a giant cleanup of trailing whitespaces. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/1fa9f22b)]

* Holger Levsen:
    * [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)-specific changes:
        * Adjust the rescheduling of packages which have been tested *X* days ago. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/14ddcf02)] [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/18a33594)] [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/90da004f)]
        * Adopt maintenance job to work with the new OSUOSL nodes. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/c8702012)]
        * Support [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) running on ports other than `22`. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/71879c41)]
        * Fix the path to the Arch Linux `mirrorlist`. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/a6675634)]
    * [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)-specific changes:
        * Fix warning message to include the name of broken package sets [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/f281ec75)] and also show the total number of packages in a package set [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/47654780)].
        * Don't update [`pbuilder`](https://wiki.debian.org/PbuilderTricks) and Debian [`schroots`](https://wiki.debian.org/Schroot) on OSUOSL nodes. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/38ed2e99)]
        * Clarify "stalled" status of the [LeMaker HiKey960](http://www.lemaker.org/product-hikeysecond-specification.html) boards. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/82b6130d)]
        * Document how to access [Codethink](https://www.codethink.co.uk/)'s `arm64` nodes. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/71b4ea09)]
    * [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/)-specific changes:
        * Remove duplicate job definitions. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/c2718ea4)]
    * Misc/generic changes:
        * Drop another mention of [LEDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEDE). [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/5f457969)]

        * Update the "job health page", adding a helpful footer. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/0b414680)] [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/d56945e4)]
        * Use `time.osuosl.org` as the [NTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol) server for OSUOSL nodes, de.pool.ntp.org for the rest. [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/060817f9)]
    * Node maintenance. ([[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/a5b35523)], [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/e86711cc)], [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/34a9e2bb)], [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/0133292e)], [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/dce5c729)], [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/6f3a20a9)], [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/20e2b9f6)], [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/99b5ae65)], [[...](https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/193fb3a3)], etc.)
