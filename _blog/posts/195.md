* t.r-b.o:
(meta comment: this weeks commits should be explained/prepended with something like the next two sentences.)
** Arch Linux is the first project being build on (2 of the) 8 nodes decidated from OSUOSL.org to us.
** Intentionally both new nodes now run 4.19 stretch-backports kernels as Qt in Arch Linux needs a newer kernel than the Debian stretch kernel and making Qt build is more relevant than building Arch Linux with kernel variation.
** Holger also increased the size of osuosl167's root partition so that it's usuable as a squid proxy for all our OSUOSL nodes.
