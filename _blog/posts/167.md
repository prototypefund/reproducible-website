Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday July 1 and Saturday July 7 2018:

* David A. Wheeler [wrote to our mailing list](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-July/001073.html) noting that the [Linux Foundation's Core Infrastructure Initiative](https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/)'s [Best Practices Badge](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/) programme [requires a reproducible build for the "gold"-level badge](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/blob/master/doc/other.md\#build_reproducible).

* A number of Chinese scientists wrote a tool to [apply heuristics to find the root cause of non-reproducibility](https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/06/22/automated-localization-for-unreproducible-builds/) from [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org) output.

* Leonel Salazar wrote to our [mailing list](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/) and [shared his plans regarding a Reproducible Builds talk in Cuba](https://lists.reproducible-builds.org/pipermail/rb-general/2018-July/001071.html), asking for assistance in promoting and translating relevant content into Spanish.

* 24 package reviews were been added, 19 have been updated and 12 have been removed in this week, adding to our [knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html). Chris Lamb also added a new [`build_path_in_apertium_mode_files`](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/7971d711) issue type.
