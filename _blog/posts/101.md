Here's what happened in the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) effort between Sunday March 26 and Saturday April 1 2017:

Media coverage
--------------

Sylvain Beucler wrote a follow-up post [Practical basics of reproducible builds
2](http://blog.beuc.net/posts/Practical_basics_of_reproducible_builds_2/),
which like [last weeks
article](http://blog.beuc.net/posts/Practical_basics_of_reproducible_builds/)
is about his experiences making software build reproducibly.


Reproducible work in other projects
-----------------------------------

Colin Watson started writing a
[patch](https://code.launchpad.net/~cjwatson/launchpad/store-buildinfo/+merge/321263)
to make launchpad store `.buildinfo` files. (It's not yet deployed.)


Toolchain development and fixes
-------------------------------

Ximin Luo continued to work on `BUILD_PATH_PREFIX_MAP` patches for [GCC
6](https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/reproducible/gcc-6.git/) and
[dpkg](https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/reproducible/dpkg.git/).
