Media coverage
--------------

Sylvain Beucler wrote a follow-up post [Practical basics of reproducible builds
2](http://blog.beuc.net/posts/Practical_basics_of_reproducible_builds_2/),
which like [last weeks
article](http://blog.beuc.net/posts/Practical_basics_of_reproducible_builds/)
is about his experiences making software build reproducibly.
