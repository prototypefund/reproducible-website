* Bernhard M. Wiedemann proposed toolchain patches
    * to [rpm](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/pull/485) to have determinism in the process of stripping debuginfo into separate packages
    * to [gzip](https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=32342) to make `tar -cz` output reproducible on the gzip side. Might also help with compressed man-pages. This was merged by gzip upstream.
