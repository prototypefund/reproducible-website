* Bernhard M. Wiedemann proposed toolchain patches
    * to [rpm](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/pull/485) to have determinism in the process of stripping debuginfo into separate packages
    * to [gzip](https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=32342) to make `tar -cz` output reproducible on the gzip side. Might also help with compressed man-pages. This was merged by gzip upstream.

* h01ger added a logo to https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds
* vagrant prepared a fixed dpkg package based on guillems work
* h01ger uploaded vagrant's dpkg package (but the process changed with the salsa move and some perms are wrong, and docuemntaion is lacking.)
* h01ger reenabled testing sid and experimental again after these changes
* https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/buster/amd64/pkg_set_CIP.html is also there now
  (Civil Infrastructure Plattform packages and their build depends are there too)
