# Help the Reproducible Builds effort!

The not-for-profit Reproducible Builds effort needs your help to continue its work towards ensuring the security of computer systems of all shapes and sizes around the world. We use any and all donated funds to ensure focused and intense work on ensuring this mission.

The Reproducible Builds project is a member of the [Software Freedom Conservancy]((https://sfconservancy.org/)), a 501(c)3 non-profit organisation. The Conservancy has allowed us to pool organisational resources with other projects, such as Selenium, Inkscape, Samba and Wine in order to reduce the management overhead associated with creating our own, dedicated legal entity.

### Benefits of sponsorship

* You (or your company) are contributing to an renowned & respected free/open source project.
* Community consciousness of your company (and its promotion of Reproducible Builds) will be increased in the minds of the wider community.
* For corporate donations that equal or are more than the Platinum level, your logo will be placed on our site for one year.
* For each six months of non-sponsorship, your logo will be moved to the next lowest sponsorship level. If your logo is in the Bronze level when this happens it will be removed.
* People find out about Reproducible Builds first from our website; having a link from our website therefore will associate you and/or your company as a supporter of the Reproducible Builds project that our users love.
* Contributions are tax-deductible.

Please see our list of [current sponsors]({{ "/who/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

### Logos

* Placement on the front page of `https://reproducible-builds.org` will be for donations that equal or are more than the *Platinum* level.
* For donations that are equal to the *Gold* level, your logo will be placed on each page of the documentation hosted at `https://reproducible-builds.org/who/`.
* Logo placement is time-based, per category: the first to donate is at the top, with subsequent sponsors' logos placed in the order they donated. Position will be maintained as long as sponsorship is continued each year.
* Logos on the front page will only be there for a year, starting from when your logo is put up on the page.
* Logos may be up to 468 pixels wide and 80 pixels tall. Platinum-level sponsors may be up to 600 pixels wide and 250 pixels tall.

### Levels

Below are the names and amounts associated with levels of sponsorship (all values in USD):

* Platinum: $250,000
* Gold: $100,000
* Silver: $50,000
* Bronze: $5,000

## Non-monetary Donations

The Reproducible Builds project will naturally consider non-monetary donations to the project such as hardware or hosting where we will set a sponsorship level appropriately. (Please note that non-monetary donations may not be tax-deductible; to confirm, you should seek the advice of a qualified tax professional. In general, we suggest cash donations, as that process is much simpler.)
