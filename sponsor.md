# Help the Reproducible Builds effort!

The not-for-profit Reproducible Builds effort needs your help to continue its work towards ensuring the security of computer systems of all shapes and sizes around the world. We use any and all donated funds to ensure focused and intense work on ensuring this mission.

The Reproducible Builds project is a member of the [Software Freedom Conservancy]((https://sfconservancy.org/)), a 501(c)3 non-profit organisation. The Conservancy has allowed us to pool organisational resources with other projects such as Selenium, Inkscape, Samba and Wine in order to reduce the management overhead associated with creating our own, dedicated legal entity.

### About the project

Whilst anyone can inspect the source code of free and open source software for
malicious flaws, most software is distributed pre-compiled to end users.

The motivation behind the Reproducible Builds project is to permit verification
that no flaws have been introduced during the compilation process—either
maliciously or accidentally—by promising identical results are always generated
from a given source, thus allowing multiple third-parties to come to a
consensus on whether a system is compromised.

Your continued support will be key in solving this important problem which
affects systems of all sizes, from embedded microcontrollers to the largest
government and corporate systems.

#### Past work

* 94% of packages in [Debian](https://debian.org/) are reproducible
  in our tests, and [Debian Policy](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/)
  now recommends that builds are reproducible. Support for our build metadata
  format (`.buildinfo`) has been merged into the official toolchain.

* Large amount of cross-distribution collaboration —
  [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/) and [Coreboot](https://www.coreboot.org/)
  now offer reproducible ISO images based heavily on our work, and
  [NetBSD](https://www.netbsd.org/) offer a reproducible base system to
  complement considerable progress from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/),
  [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) and
  [ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org/). In addition, we are also providing
  continuous reproducible builds testing for eight Linux distributions.

* Core patches written and submitted for GCC, R and Go, Rust introduced
  "file maps" in support of reproducibility after our feedback.

* A number of highly lauded presentations (LCA, Embedded Linux onference,
  LibrePlanet, Scale15x, CCC, OSSE, LinuxCon China, Open Compliance Summit,
  etc.) as well highly-productive meetups in "real life".

* Countless features in [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/)
  and other tools; 1000s of lines changed with extensive use outside of a
  reproducibility context.

* Mentoring in [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) and
  [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) to ease inclusion of new
  contributors especially ones from under-represented groups in technology.

* Almost 3 years of regular weekly newsletters as well as IRC-based
  meetings. Friendly communications have ensured that newcomers from all
  backgrounds feel involved and welcome.

#### Future work

The Reproducible Builds team has demonstrated that it is, in principle,
possible to build a Linux distribution in a reproducible manner and have solved
many of the issues in doing so.

However, the next release of Debian ("bullseye") is currently not yet 100%
reproducible and funding to support on-going maintenance of critical
infrastructure will be absolutely essential to reach this goal.

This not only includes the administration of over 50 build nodes across
multiple architectures, it requires continuous and patient work with package
maintainers and upstreams to merge reproducibility-related patches. It also
includes extending the scope of [our testing
framework](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/) to even more projects, as
well as improving the existing tests and reports.

In addition, there are currently no tools that let a user know whether packages
that they are installing are reproducible or not, required to "close the loop"
and allow end-users to finally truly validate the software they are running on
their machines.

Furthermore, maintaining momentum — both in terms of public perception and in
private — around the various related projects such as *diffoscope*, etc. will
be key in ensuring a reproducible "buster" becomes a reality.

### Benefits of sponsorship

* You (or your company) are contributing to an renowned and respected free/open source project.
* Community consciousness of your company (and its promotion of Reproducible Builds) will be increased in the minds of the wider community.
* For corporate donations that equal or are more than the Platinum level, your logo will be placed on our site for one year.
* People find out about Reproducible Builds first from our website; having a link from our website therefore will associate you and/or your company as a supporter of the well-known and respected Reproducible Builds project.
* Contributions are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.

**Please see our list of [current sponsors]({{ "/who/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).**

### Logos

* Placement on the front page of `https://reproducible-builds.org` will be for donations that equal or are more than the *Platinum* level.
* For donations that are equal to the *Gold* level, your logo will be placed on each page of the documentation hosted at `https://reproducible-builds.org/who/`.
* Logo placement is time-based, per category: the first to donate is at the top, with subsequent sponsors' logos placed in the order they donated. Position will be maintained as long as sponsorship is continued each year.
* Logos on the front page will only be there for a year, starting from when your logo is put up on the page.
* Logos may be up to 468 pixels wide and 80 pixels tall. Platinum-level sponsors may be up to 600 pixels wide and 250 pixels tall.

### Levels

Below are the names and amounts associated with levels of sponsorship (all values in USD):

* Platinum: $250,000
* Gold: $100,000
* Silver: $50,000
* Bronze: $5,000

## Non-monetary Donations

The Reproducible Builds project will naturally consider non-monetary donations to the project such as hardware or hosting where we will set a sponsorship level appropriately. (Please note that non-monetary donations may not be tax-deductible; to confirm, you should seek the advice of a qualified tax professional. In general, we suggest cash donations, as that process is much simpler.)
