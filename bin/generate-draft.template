**Welcome to the {{ month_year }} report from the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) project!**
{: .lead}

{% raw %}
[![]({{ "/images/reports/{{ title_year }}-{{ title_month }}/reproducible-builds.png#right" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://reproducible-builds.org/)
{% endraw %}

In these reports we outline the most important things that we have been up to over the past month. As a quick recap, whilst anyone may inspect the source code of free software for malicious flaws, almost all software is distributed to end users as pre-compiled binaries.

The motivation behind the reproducible builds effort is to ensure no flaws have been introduced during this compilation process by promising identical results are always generated from a given source, thus allowing multiple third-parties to come to a consensus on whether a build was compromised.

In this month's report, we cover:

* **Media coverage** — *FIXME, etc.*
* **Upstream news** — *FIXME, etc.*
* **Distribution work** — *FIXME, etc.*
* **Software development** — *FIXME, etc.*
* **Misc news** — *From our mailing list, etc.*
* **Getting in touch** — *How to contribute, etc*

[![]({{ "/images/reports/{{ title_year }}-{{ title_month }}/opensuse.png#right" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://www.opensuse.org/)

[![]({{ "/images/reports/{{ title_year }}-{{ title_month }}/debian.png#center" | prepend: site.baseurl }})](https://debian.org/)
{% endraw %}

In Debian:

* {{ packages_stats['added'] }} reviews of Debian packages were added, {{ packages_stats['updated'] }} were updated and {{ packages_stats['removed'] }} were removed this month adding to [our knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html). FIXME issue types have been updated: {% for _, xs in issues_yml.items()|sort %}{% for x in xs %}[{{ x['title'] }}](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/{{ x['sha'] }}), {% endfor %}{% endfor %}

## Software development

#### Upstream patches

The Reproducible Builds project detects, dissects and attempts to fix as many currently-unreproducible packages as possible. We endeavour to send all of our patches upstream where appropriate. This month, we wrote a large number of such patches, including:

{% for x, ys in patches.items()|sort %}* {{ x }}:
{% for y in ys %}    * [#{{ y['id'] }}](https://bugs.debian.org/{{ y['id'] }}) filed against [{{ y['source'] }}](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/{{ y['source'] }}).
{% endfor %}{% endfor %}
{% if ftbfs_bugs %}
In addition, build failure bugs were reported by:
{% for k, v in ftbfs_bugs.items()|sort %}
* {{ k }} ({{ v|length }}){% endfor %}{% endif %}

{% for project in projects %}
#### {{ project }}
{% for x in uploads[project] %}
{{ project }} version `{{ x['version'] }}` was [uploaded to Debian {{ x['distribution'] }}](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/{{ project }}?FIXME) by {{ x['signed_by_name'] }}. It [included contributions already covered in previous months](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/{{ project }}/commits/{% if project != 'diffoscope' %}debian/{% endif %}{{ x['version'] }}) as well as new ones from:

{% endfor %}
{% for x, ys in commits[project].items()|sort %}* {{ x }}:{% for y in ys %}
    * {{ y['title'] }}.&nbsp;[[...]({% if project == "jenkins.debian.net" %}https://salsa.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net/commit/{{ y['sha'] }}{% else %}https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/{{ project }}/commit/{{ y['sha'] }}{% endif %})]{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
