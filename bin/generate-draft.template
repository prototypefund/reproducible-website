* {{ packages_stats['added'] }} Debian package reviews were added, {{ packages_stats['updated'] }} were updated and {{ packages_stats['removed'] }} were removed in this week, adding to [our knowledge about identified issues](https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/index_issues.html). FIXME issue types have been updated: {% for _, xs in issues_yml.items()|sort %}{% for x in xs %}[{{ x['title'] }}](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/reproducible-notes/commit/{{ x['sha'] }}), {% endfor %}{% endfor %}

## Packages reviewed and fixed, and bugs filed

{% for x, ys in patches.items()|sort %}* {{ x }}:

{% endfor %}{% endfor %}
{% if ftbfs_bugs %}
In addition, build failure bugs were reported by:
{% for k, v in ftbfs_bugs.items()|sort %}
